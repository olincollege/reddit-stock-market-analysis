0,"Georgia Bulldogs and Alabama Crimson Tide will play in the National Championship - Long $BUD, $MO, and Babies named Kirby","Alabama and Georgia will play for the College Football National Championship next Monday in Atlanta, GA. This game is predicted to have the highest priced tickets in college football history because both teams are so close to the game. DD...

Long $BUD - makers of Budweiser, Bud Light, Busch Light, and Natty Light. Nuff said..

Long $MO - makers of Marlboro, Skoal, Copenhagen, and Husky. Go long mouth cancer treatment companies for the real long play here. 

Long babies named Kirby, Nick, Jake, and Jalen. Long any baby camo outfit companies as well. Sales are going to be record breaking in 9 months. Long babies named Kody too - seems to be a popular name among the people of the Confederate States. 

Both teams have red or a red-ish color in their logos. Long red dye futures for all the memorabilia/talking bass/truck flags that will be produced.

Any other potential plays here fellas? This could be a game-changer in 2018.",2018-01-01 23:35:22,"['BUD', 'MO', 'BUD', 'MO']"
