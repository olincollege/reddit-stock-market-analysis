This game is predicted to have the highest priced tickets in college football history because both teams are so close to the game. DD...

Long $BUD - makers of Budweiser, Bud Light, Busch Light, and Natty Light. Nuff said..

Long $MO - makers of Marlboro, Skoal, Copenhagen, and Husky. Go long mouth cancer treatment companies for the real long play here. 

Long babies named Kirby, Nick, Jake, and Jalen. Long any baby camo outfit companies as well. Sales are going to be record breaking in 9 months. Long babies named Kody too - seems to be a popular name among the people of the Confederate States. 

Both teams have red or a red-ish color in their logos. Long red dye futures for all the memorabilia/talking bass/truck flags that will be produced.

Any other potential plays here fellas? This could be a game-changer in 2018.",2018-01-01 23:35:22,"['BUD', 'MO', 'BUD', 'MO']"

0,"Long $AMD, Massive Intel In-Hardware Security Bug Found (Hotfix Requires -30% Perf Penalty)","You faggots doubted SuBae, but her journey to the moon is undaunted by your cum-guzzling ways. 

Confirmed homosexual firm, $INTC, will be announcing [a massive in-hardware security bug in its modern processors that will require a **-30% performance penalty** to hotfix it](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7nl8r0/intel_bug_incoming/). This will notably affect large datacenter customers such as $GOOG and $AMZN (short them for maximum tendies). 

* As an in-hardware bug, this is not easy to fix and will require a brutal hotfix as a temporary measure. A less destructive fix will not be available until the hardware is replaced with updated models in the coming years (as if customers would choose to buy more $INTC products after this!). 

* The bug is currently under embargo much like $INTC is still officially in the closet. In the coming days, $INTC will publicly acknowledge its sexual orientation and the existence of this bug. 

* [$INTC's CEO sold off $11M of $INTC stock less than two weeks ago](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/12/19/intels-ceo-just-sold-a-lot-of-stock.aspx) and now holds the bare minimum number of shares required by the CEO according to $INTC by-laws. Looks like he's getting his yacht while he still can! 

* Competing processors made by SuBae are confirmed to not be affected by this vulnerability as their architecture is much girthier. 

This leaves **SuBae poised to fuck the competition up the ass** on large datacenter contracts. 

* $AMD has recently [ramped up production on their 32-core ""EPYC"" CPU](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12032/amd-announces-wider-epyc-availability-and-rocm-17-with-tensorflow-support) that competes in the datacenter market. 

* Not only does the 32C EPYC have more cores than $INTC's flaccid 28C CPU, but [EPYC costs half as much](https://www.anandtech.com/show/11544/intel-skylake-ep-vs-amd-epyc-7000-cpu-battle-of-the-decade/10). 

* SuBae is rumored to release an [EPYC 2.0 with an even more turgid 64-core CPU as early as 2019](https://hothardware.com/news/amd-epyc-2-64-cores-128-threads-and-256mb-l3-cache). 

 * Impotent traitor, [Raja Kodorki, is confirmed to not be involved with Epyc in any way](http://www.pcgamer.com/amd-radeon-boss-raja-koduri-joins-intel-to-work-on-integrated-and-discrete-graphics/) and will only be adding performance issues to $INTC products going forward. 

* SuBae won't rest until EPYC is packed deep into datacenters everywhere, leaving $INTC frustrated and on the streets to beg for tendies. 

I see **$AMD trading at $15 by weeks end**. It's yacht time, faggots. ",2018-01-02 19:18:07,"['AMD', 'INTC', 'GOOG', 'AMZN', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'AMD', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'AMD']"
