* **Introductory Ramblings**

As for $PTLA, I wrote [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8gwc3h/ptla_fda_approval_what_you_need_to_know_and_what/) here about approval of Andexxa. Even though I was correct, the play was not profitable if you held up until now. I personally believe that $PTLA is *heavily* undervalued and that buying into it right now holds very little risk when looking at it from a 12-month perspective. I have no price target for this play but I do have two potential price catalysts for the following 12 months. I have never given a 12-month prediction on here before because my plays are much shorter in general. I expect this play to be shorter than 12 months, but I am confident in it enough that I will hold and average down for an entire 12 months - if necessary. 

On another note, what spurred me to write this thread was Portola's graph today. Portola seems to have a heavy floor of $29/share today due to someone, or some entity, with a large limit-buy of $29/share. Whether this holds is beyond the point because times like these are always very interesting to me. Some one or some group out there is confident enough to create their own resistance. Now, it could be due to another reason, such as market makers pinning the price so options remain worthless. Options volume isn't strong enough for that in my opinion. Whatever the reason, and I know I'm rambling here, I found today's graph interesting and it convinced me to finally write this post. I've been wanting to write something on Portola for months now. 

-

-

* **Lengthy Background. Skip if you want.**

Portola's current troubles are not unlike Omeros' ($OMER) initial, unfortunate troubles with management and marketing. Although I will say that as far as bad management goes, Portola is much worse than Omeros' management used to be. On the other end of this stick, Portola's pipeline is magnitudes stronger than Omeros' pipeline. 

I will eventually write a longer article on this topic and about pharmaceuticals in general. The gist of it is that, while bad management can drive down stock price in the short-term, and is something to look out for when heading into FDA approvals -- due to badly written or performed studies, among other things -- a strong drug will remain a strong drug. And no company, no matter how horrible their management is, will be able to hold onto a multi billion-dollar drug and let it go to waste. Make no mistake, Andexxa can and will, either under Portola or another pharmaceutical company, generate net revenue well into the billions. 

I personally am of the belief that a well-marketed and produced Andexxa alone would have been worth over 4 billion dollars had it been approved and produced during its first PDUFA. Portola has wasted 2 years of patent time on Andexxa, but that's no matter. It will still net billions. 

-

The reason Portola dropped is because they had a loss of 106.2M in their most recently reported quarter. On top of this, their drugs were massively under-marketed. The most worrisome was Bevyxxa's revenue. Andexxa we knew was going to be low due to Portola's inferior production capabilities and [self-imposed restrictions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8gwc3h/ptla_fda_approval_what_you_need_to_know_and_what/dyftjin/) Regarding Portola's unusual decision in limiting sales of Andexxa, some theorize that Portola is pushing for better treatment results to leverage a buyout offer, though I am on the fence about such a theory. I am neither completely sold nor disagreeing. I will explain more another time. 

Bevyxxa's revenue being low points to a marketing team that is not ready, at all, to pitch sales to hospitals around the country. I say this a lot, but I will save longer explanation for when I write a longer article. I need to speak with a lawyer in half an hour, so I don't have much time here. Bevyxxa, not nearly as valuable as Andexxa, is a good drug worth a lot of money (I won't give it my own price target like I did for Andexxa). Its success hinges on Portola being able to convince hospitals to restructure the way they care for patients. This requires more effort than simply saying, hey, our drug is good. It takes a talented marketing team, whereas something like Andexxa would sell itself. 

When Portola reported a disappointing quarter, it cast into doubt their ability to market a complicated drug like Bevyxxa in the first place. Holding this concern and labeling it an unfortunate eventuality still does not, in my opinion, justify Portola's drop to such a low valuation of sub 2 billion dollars. Portola may be bad, but they cannot hold onto these two drugs forever and waste their potential. They are a publicly traded company and eventually the hammer will come down. It's just politics. 

Now, *when* that hammer comes down is another argument, but it will. And I highly doubt it would take more than 6 months. 

-

-

* **The Potential Catalysts**

The biggest potential catalyst is a buyout, and while I believe it's very possible for Portola, I do think that management are far too stuck up their asses to do it just yet. Once a company makes bad decision after bad decision, investors will stop giving them the benefit of the doubt. Portola is in this position right now. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, Portola needed approval of Andexxa first before they could consider selling themselves. They also need approval of their recently submitted PAS, which has a decision date by the end of this calendar year. 

This leads me into the next catalyst, which is approval of the PAS. This would open up Portola to mass-produce Andexxa and market it around the entire country. They would be able to do so the very next day. This alone is such a huge catalyst that it cannot be understated. Investors don't entirely believe it will be successful. This however doesn't matter to me because, if it's not successful, Portola will be forced to sell themselves to another company. These two catalysts are tied because I believe my prior theory to be unavoidable. Portola will not be able to justify wasting another year of Andexxa's patent life on a fourth failed approval attempt, and they will have to sell to a larger pharmaceutical company that can effectively tackle production and marketing.

If PAS does gain approval, not only will share price increase, potential for a larger buyout offer goes through the roof. However... I think Portola's management is misguided enough to think that they can market and produce their drugs effectively and make more money without going for a buyout. I don't know their internal revenue estimates or what buyout offers they've been receiving, but outside investors can only stare from the outside within and hypothesize that a buyout is off the table if Portola can generate positive EPS and keep up with production. 

Regardless of their mystic inner workings, I think a buyout is unlikely only because of how many bad decisions Portola has made thus far. I would not put it past them to make another bad decision. I could be off the mark and giving Portola's management a hard time, which I admittedly always have, but I need to see at least approval of PAS before I will change my mind on this. 

There are other catalysts, but these are the most pivotal.

* **The Plays**

Basically I'm long on shares and I have tons of 2019 calls. I'm not leveraged in the margin-sense. I just have a lot of OTM calls for pretty much everything in 2019. I have strikes ranging from $35/share to $90/share. I bought and sold my $30 and $35 strike calls for a nice profit because I, by chance, timed the drop and rise from $25/share to over $28/share really well. 

I have no price target for this play because the price target can vary from $50/share with approval of PAS to over $100/share with a buyout. Depending on the catalyst, Portola's share price is not predictable, which is why I have so many different calls at different strikes. I also have shares in case my timing is completely wrong and my options expire worthless. 

This play, if you buy options, is incredibly risky. As are most of my plays involving options. You can buy and hold shares for significantly less risk, as long as your horizon is 12 months, but that is of course my humble opinion. Me being confident in this play does not mean you should automatically be equally as confident.

Germanys GDP is growing and the euro is weak. This means BMW has an advantage when it comes to exporting. Also the crisis in Spain and in Italy will lead to investors fleeing from these markets and imvesting their money in Germany.

Important note: Prices are in euros!

Technical:
Support at 83.50
Resistance at 92

The stock traded sideways after breaking out in march 2015. Their is still an uptrend bit you got to keep an eye on that support. If it drops below 83.50 the next support is at 78. The stock was at 93.30 before paying dividends. So their is a big chance the stock will break the resistance again.

Downside:
Trump is an old cuck who loves tariffs. But the EU is a strong ally so I believe their is no way he will imply the tariffs. Also BMW doesn‘t seem to care about Trump threating them. Nevertheless you should pay attention and be ready to see the stock bleed -&gt; great buying chance.

I currently have a long position at 16.9$ on Silver because I believe that the depreciation of the USD will continue however I'm still somewhat hesitant due to the ongoing daily manipulation which they endure. Been trading them for 5/6 months and 9 times out of 10 they tank as soon as Wall Street opens, doesn't matter how the USDX is performing or how the stocks are doing. This isn't some tin foil conspiracy theory and it has been proven several times.

Someone's gotta put those tendies on the table right?

*ASSUMING WE HAVE A GREEN DAY/GREEN WEEK(s)*


**VIX Puts**

Jumped **6** points Friday and **19** points Monday.

Trading at **39.XX**(4:48AM EST) Closed @ 37

52 Week average is between 13-10

With this I'm confident it wouldn't instantly drop back to the teens(11-19), I believe that if we have a half decent day, we might get to 21-25, but that's only today, if the green continues we could hit upper teens.  I wouldn't go for February 7th, that's extremely ballsy and certainly plenty of money to make in this volatility, but you could also be donating your money to Goldman Sachs if the market flips.

**In short** I'm looking at February 14th or 21st 21-24P

 **UVXY Puts**

Jumped **3** points Friday and **11** points Monday

Trading at **28.XX**(5:07AM EST)  Closed @ 22

52 Week average is between 14-16

I really don't think this would drop AS hard as $VIX would, but I could be wrong.  I'd be more willing to purchase 1-2 month out puts on this but give me your ideas.

**In short** I'm looking at March-April 18-20P

**TQQQ/QQQ Calls**

TQQQ dropped **8** points Friday and **15** points Monday

$TQQQ trades at 140.xx(5:18AM EST)

QQQ dropped **3** points Friday and **5** points Monday

$QQQ trades at 157.xx(5:18AM EST)

I grouped these together because TQQQ is a 3x leveraged QQQ, if you're new here you might not know that.  We choose to jerk these two off till their raw meat.  Between these two aim pretty torn.  On one hand I feel this market is already bringing enough volatility, so no need to 3x it with TQQQ, but on the other, if you pick right you could make away huge.  It's really up to you on how safe you're feeling.  Looking at the premiums right now though, these look pretty overvalued to me.  You have strike prices and premiums that have a massive jump almost already priced in.  Let me know what you think though.

**SPY/SPX**  

These ones have also had their fair share of beatings as of late, but it seems, in my opinion, maybe you differ, that it's too late to get in these at a solid price.  You have crazy premiums spread out everywhere.  Tell me what you think though.

By contrast, big growth has gained 9.2% per annum and small growth 9.6%. Because of the magic of compounding over 75 years, these are staggering differences. One dollar invested in each index in 1927 would be worth today $35,957 if you had put it into small value, $4,802 into large value, $1,089 in small growth, and $820 in large growth!

0,121,Facebook's Comeback? DD Inside,"Miss the boat on NVDA? Well don't be sad, fellow autist, because next week is a new week. A new week for you to lose another 35% of your portfolio, come to terms with your autistic (and rapidly devaluing) $90 MU calls, and long $ROPE. Today I am writing up about FaceBook (FB), which was recently rammed in the ass after Q2 earnings. Here's my take on why there is a short term, high profitability play in store, and why the Z u c c will offer us his precious tendies. 

**Technical Analysis** 
1. [Bear Pennant pattern formation](https://gyazo.com/c24eebdc543f314ee57a49ab37c5687f) - Simply put, as long as we can safely jump off of the ~$171 support line (and not have a bearish breakout), I see a short term breakout as high as the low $190's in the next month. I will go into more detail as to why I don't see us having a bearish breakout later on. 

2. [MACD](https://gyazo.com/8f63aec72b200644a2580d1e1986f122) &amp; [RSI](https://gyazo.com/8ae20c9a243bd2bf2bc568b439366d96) - Both the MACD and RSI have been pretty strong indicators of trend reversals when it comes to FB, and I see no reason why this would be any different. The MACD line has just crossed the signal line (bullish indicator) and RSI has bounced off of the 30 line and is approaching neutral strength (currently 47 ish). Historically, when FB has shifted momentum like this, it's held onto bullish momentum (at least enough to sell well in the green). 

**Fundamental Analysis**
FB is, by far, the largest player in the social media industry. They are well diversified (FB, Instagram, Whatsapp, Oculus VR, [See Full](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Facebook)) within the industry... they are certainly not a ""one pony show."" Quite aggressive profit machines, I still see a massive amount of upside. If you had to ask me, the selloff was justified, but simply left FB oversold. Expect this drop to signify a key support line that we seem to be bouncing away from. In the long haul, the experts [are still bullish](https://postanalyst.com/2018/08/24/technical-roundup-on-two-stocks-facebook-inc-fb-geron-corporation-gern/) as well. 

Keep in mind that we are in the largest bull run in history. Judge Facebook's performance against the S&amp;P and you will see an even more staggering signal to buy. FB is not going anywhere, and there is a lot of money to be made if you time your buys and sells right. 

**Conclusion:**
Try buying FB as close to the low $170's as possible. I expect this play to unfold within the next 2 weeks or so but buy a month out to be safe. Mix up some FDs and ITM options with stock if you swing like that. Fin",2018-08-25 23:04:46,['ROPE']

0,125,Saturday Short: $ZN - Zion Oil and Gas,"Good morning losers, 

I present you the best short on the market other than Tesla. $ZN

This shitty company has somehow existed for 18 fucking years on the thesis of drilling for oil in Israel. With zero revenue to date, Zion has raised capital by advertising via televangelists, claiming they will fulfill a biblical prophesy. This can be seen by the massive marketing expenses in their 10k. 

Their employees then embezzle most of this money with ludicrous salaries. Of the 33 employees in the company, the median salary is 139k, with the CEO bringing home 450k/year. Over the years, they have taken home 17% of all capital raised. 

Earlier this year, Zion made claims that their well #5 had struck oil, and would asses the commercial viability over the next few weeks. Some three months later, Zion announced the well had proven to be commercially unsuccessful and would need capital to move forward in drilling more wells. 

Zion has been able to raise capital via equity dilution over the last 18 years, but has run into headwinds with an SEC investigation at their door. This requires them to disclose the investigation as a part of any equity raise. Now the company has roughly $8m of cash on the books, 6.7m of it earmarked for current liabilities. The company is also entangled in a class action lawsuit which could result in another couple million in liability. On top of it all, the company maintains burn-rate of roughly 2m a quarter. 

With the stock down 80% off it’s 2018 highs, the stock currently sits a 1.53. Given the inevitability of delisting/and or bankruptcy, the $1 puts for any maturity are an attractive purchase. My personal strategy is to own an assortment of puts from Sep18 to Mar19. 

TLDR: $ZN has no revenue, and exists by selling stock to gullible bible belters  SEC now involved, stock going to 0.

0,151,$DIS DD,"Fundamental:

New TV\-series and merchandise for the younger ones and the parks for the housewifes who once dreamed to be a princess are the main income for DIS and the companys cash cows. The last earnings showed that the revenue from the parks are growing. Movies breaking records and milking of beloved franchises \(Star Wars\) continue to be the stars. As Cramer said no other company other then AAPL and DIS are capable of producing recordbreaking products EVERY year.

The Fox merger is about to pass. There is no chance Comcast will outbid Disney without going in deep depth. Disney is about to get the biggest part of Hulu who has 30 new series in the pipeline.

Next year Disney will launch their new streaming platform. Together with all the other income that Disney produces they have alot of power to produce new content. Netflix only has the streaming platform as main income to produce content. Disneys will beat Netflix in the long run.

Technical:

Disney moved  between 91 and 116 for a long time. Even with bigger market corrections the stock didn't go under 91. This shows that Disney is a stable company that won't go anywhere in near future.

If you want to make constant gains, try swingtrading the stock.

I personally recommend buying everytime the stock falls below 100 and holding it.

Downside:

DIS investors als old cucks who only care about ESPN. They do not understand the potential of the upcoming streaming service. ESPN is already priced in. The Moment DIS announces a major change to ESPN the stock will brake out. Also DIS might go for SKY and europe fags like myself watch alot of Football and pay for it..

My estimation:

DIS will start to raise beginning with the launch of the streaming platform and will reach $200 at the end of next year.

DIS is a safe investment and a stable company with a bright future",2018-05-25 12:13:55,['DIS']

0,158,Some FEYE DD from a noob,"Hello all, I'm kind of a noob to trading as I only started in June, but I've been trading heavily since then. I paid my tuition in the form of IQ, but I've bounced back since then on some non-meme plays. Anyways, basically what I'm trying to get across is that you shouldn't listen to me at all, as I'm probably retarded. But maybe you'll find this useful.

So $FEYE recently had earnings last week 1-AUG-2018, and their earnings call reported that their customers were happy to refresh their service contracts as well as add on new products, in fact the trend appearedto be for customers to add on new products overall. They reported growth with their Helix suite, and they beat earnings (estimate -0.01, actual 0.00), and raised guidance. That's the TLDR version, anyways. So outlook seems great for FireEye, and I'm personally bullish as I think they have a great product and a good position in the market. The cyber security space is crowded, true, and we will definitely see consolidation in the future, but I think FireEye stands a chance of coming out on top. 

But the real reason to play this stock, imo, is the short term cyclical nature of the stock. I think this stock is quite similar to MU in the fact that it quite reliably goes up, then down within a pretty consistent range of $15 on the low end, and $17-18 on the high end. Right now, the RSI for this stock is at 36, and to my eyes the MACD is at an inflection point, heading towards the signal line. On balance volume has been growing steadily since late june/early july, and overall I think the technicals look like the stock is about to go back into the $16-17 range as the cycle continues.

I'm personally holding 30 contracts 16C 9/21 @0.38 per contract. Last time I played this stock I bought a 15C expiry was in july. Cant remember the date, but i closed the position with 94% profit on the call.  

I'm interested in what you all think of this stock, I did a search and it seems like WSB has played it before but not recently it seems. ",2018-08-07 17:39:26,['FEYE']

$BTU largest coal operations firm in the World

Outlook:

	Earning call is February 7, 2018. -15.9% projected revenue growth provides evidence that $BTU will struggle to meet revenue estimates. $BTU is highly leveraged with a debt/equity ratio of over 2500%. Additionally $BTU has a negative return on equity ( -18.2%) and assets (-.09). $BTU’s trading and brokerage operations reported a revenue loss of -10.90M. $BTU’s projected 3 year revenue growth in its U.S. and Australian mining operations are -11.33% and -12.96%, respectively, which reflects a gross misallocation of resources. Under, “Other” operations, generating revenue of $19.10M in 2016, reported a projected 3 year revenue growth of -20.40%.

The competitive nature of Natural Gas prices pose a threat to coal consumption which could lead to a global oversupply. $BTU is an obvious short sale because all operations are based in primarily democratic states who can impose environmental regulation. 

Additionally, $BTU’s current stream of revenue, as well as future revenue growth, put to question whether or not $BTU faces a general opportunity cost: whether or not C02 allowances are worth their cost when considering revenue declines.

One should also take into consideration the current and forecasted decline in US coal consumption and exports. This may be attributed to an increased use in natural gas and recent cost reductions concerning renewable energy.

$BTU is an obvious short sale because all operations are based in primarily democratic states who can impose environmental regulation. Additionally, $BTU is one of the only firms which does not run operations out of the appalachians.

Outlook:

	2018 is due to be a big year for Martin Marietta Materials. Following the passage of President Trump’s historic tax overhaul, the President’s persistence is now focused on pushing his infrastructure agenda through Capitol Hill. It is anticipated that President Trump’s infrastructure spending bill will reap numerous benefits for the U.S. Economy and U.S. firms that are leaders in the infrastructure repair and rebuild sector alike. In my opinion, President Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts bill overhaul, combined with mass infrastructure spending, will improve both GDP and consumer confidence.   
          The increase in GDP will be a ancillary result of an increase in government spending - due to the spending increase inherent in the Bill.  An increase in GDP will also, in turn, inspire consumer confidence as a byproduct, which is certain to encourage startups, manufacturing and inventory expansion, and overall growth in many sectors of the US economy. In addition, an increase in personal consumption attributed not only to government contracting in the private industry, but also to personal and business tax cuts, will give certain domestic industries that have been impacted by price/cost downward pressures, evidenced by the absolutely stagnant rate of inflation for the past 8 years, some breathing room on inventory and pricing increase.   
        One sector of these industries that will be positively impacted will be the aggregates and heavy materials building companies. Due to massive cutbacks in the DOT - employment went from 16k to 10k in 10 years - it is likely that the DOT will need to begin outsourcing differently, and will likely turn to the U.S. private sector to advance the pace of infrastructure work that the Trump Administration has prioritized for US cities and highways, infrastructure repairs, and rebuilds. It is my opinion that industry-leading basic materials firms like Vulcan Materials and Martin Marietta Materials will be well-positioned to garner the lion’s share of these contracts. The decision between the two companies will come down to competitive bidding, as well as to preexisting established relationships with the current Presidential Administration

After decreased guidance due to Amazon (one of their biggest customers) decreasing demand on their 40G fiber, it has been free falling since August from $100 to currently $38,37.

https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aaoi

I have been doing the dirty job for you to catch and baghold this POS at $60, $50, $40 and $38. It finally seems to have consolidated with a support a bit above $37. Also for the past week volume has been very low compared to average and according to finviz it has a short float of 60%. So on good news this should burst.

The risk is that they were too dependent on Amazon, the company fundamentals seems to be solid and undervalued at the moment due to FUD. Current P/E=9, forward P/E=11, P/S=1.9. Since november some insiders like director Alan Moore have started to get back in in bulk. 

Market sector has been flat-downish, other relevant competitors might be $OCLR or $FNSR.

In a set of internal memos, the heads of engineering and production at Tesla are trying to ramp up production for Model 3s to exceed 300 cars a day in order to show up the ""haters."" According to them, this would be a big win and make shorts regret betting against them. It does not confirm if they have even reached 300 models produced per day.

In reality, this confirms predictions that Tesla will miss promised production targets, again. Tesla promised to increase model production rates to 2500 cars per week.  With some simple math, assuming the factory operates 7 days week producing 300 cars per day, that's only 2100 per week. Tesla's promises to improve production have allowed them to secure more capital. This does not help their situation, as they are recalling the Model S. If they miss big again, lines or credit and access to capital markets will be limited.

0,338,Puts on $PLAY for earnings on Friday morning.,"So I’ve sworn off earnings plays for a while, but if I was a degenerate fuckhead, I’d be looking at puts on $PLAY for this Friday’s earnings.

Main reasoning being that $PLAY (Dave &amp; Buster’s) derives a lot of business from “corporate outings”. For those of you that don’t work with the washed masses in the corporate business world, these are generally departmental outings where everyone goes out during the afternoon to blow off some steam and see if they can land their very own #metoo moment over by the machine you drop tokens into hoping to push other tokens off the magnetically protected cliff. It’s a good catch all place where everyone can eat and generally have a decent time away from the office.

But if some of you recall from a few weeks back, $ELY earnings plays were being hyped simply due to the fact they hold a ownership stake in Top Golf. Rightly so, their ER was strong and the stock had a nice pop. 

I don’t know what some of you may have observed, but these things are raping and pillaging the corporate outings customer base. Top Golf has been popping up in major cities left and right and they are always PACKED. I’ve got to think this is pulling business away from $PLAY, and I’m curios to see if they mention lowered guidance, revenues, or even just cop to the fact they are facing increased competition.

Anyways, do what you will with this info.

This will be huge for the Hemp sector, and reviewing CWEBs prospectus, recent private placements, they're setting themselves up to produce and manufacture Hemp for their CBD oils and many other product lines. Keeping a close eye on this stock play, as they're #1 in the CBD sector. The MJ sector has been a hot one, CBD is just starting

Upcoming catalysts:

*Farm Bill passing with Hemp clause end of September
*US markets OTC opened Today
*MJ bill October in Canada

Basically we have a company with quarterly sales of $17M, $1M Debt, and sitting on $250-$400M cash.

With a valuation of $1.4B or 1/6th TLRY. Additionally, low share float and solid financials is what's driving the demand. Think TLRY but with exponentially better financials. Also, CWEB releases ER today

Additional notes:
* CVSI (arguably $Cwebs main competitor) is now underwater due to securities fraud (lied about patent filing to Shareholders). Shady management, dealings, and just in general a sketch company.

While Estee Lauder's relatively outside US exposure remains a drag on growth, its leadership position among Chinese consumers is proving an enviable strength today. While analysts expect the quarter to be a positive catalyst for shares, option investors are more worried. In fact, one month normalized skew is at its 81%-ile over the past year ahead of earnings.

Why can't we just have digital payments like they do in China? WeChat Pay charges .6%, which is way cheaper than the 2.75% that Square charges which is in line with other merchant banks. 

I think every time Bezos sees this 0.3% fee he has to pay to Visa or Mastercard plus merchant bank fees he unzips and begins to masturbate out of pure rage. That's $450M a year. Why do you think AMZN wants to get into financial services?

I understand the 2.75% is largely based on credit risk and basically pays for consumer protection but there are better debit-based ways we can solve this problem. Consumer should bear the cost of consumer protection or they should guard their wallet better. It's basically theft to charge 2.75% for debit cards since they carry much less chargeback risk than credit cards. Or use mobile-based security like face recognition that solves the problem with technology. Or just have an account on Amazon. They have my sensitive information anyway.

It's time to disintimate. And this is gonna happen in like 5-10 years I guarantee it.

0,366,Why to Long $GPRO,"At first glance, $GPRO seems like the perfect example of a failed technology stock, almost identical to $FIT. Its founders must have left the company to rot, having already made billions at IPO. And while that's true to an extent, it only needs to pivot in order to escape the fate of its peers.

The GoPro brand still stands strong, even with weak sales. Its [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/GoProCamera) has over five million subscribers and it maintains a good position on [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=gopro). And all of their cameras are of high quality and have good reviews. By all accounts, they should be a success. But their lack of success comes from a lack of product-market fit and a lackluster attempt at fixing that problem.

The best explanation for GoPro's sales decline comes from amateurs only ever buying one GoPro in their lives. But that's mainly a property of consumers, who usually have less available funds and are usually content. This is why $FIT failed as well: consumers have flat demands that can be met too easily. Companies, meanwhile, need to invest in the best equipment in order to produce the best products lest they get outcompeted. That's how drone and camera companies mainly survive, as they sell to small to large video production companies.

GoPro knows this, and that's why they released the Karma. Had they applied the same level of quality that they did to their cameras, it could have saved the company. But instead, they produced a mediocre product with an above average price. It's hard to tell why that happened, though hopefully, [the CEO pay cut](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/26/gopro-ceo-sees-salary-slashed-to-1-after-dire-2017.html) will incentivize better behavior. Also, there exist other markets such as VR cameras that GoPro can enter that have a lower probability of failure.

And if that does not work, there always exists the possibility of an acquisition. GoPro has what many other companies do not: a streamlined production pipeline. Point is, there's a higher probability that GoPro can get itself out of its hole than what its stock price says.

0,370,Long $LOMA (DD inside).,"So, LOMA, is one of the main building materials company in Argentina, a country in which the current administration has decided to spend a shit ton of money on reviving its crumbling infraestructure.

Yes, Argentina has currently hit  a speed bump and it will probably cut down on some infra spending, but the introduction of PPP (private-public partnerships) might as well offset those cuts.

With all that said you would expect Loma to have been doing quite well in this past months, right? Wrong.

The stock has fallen over 45% in the last month. Something pretty remarkable for a stock thats demolishing earnings estimate and has a whooping 136 for a PEG ratio.

So, why has the stock of a company with a 20% operating margin, 70% Quarterly Earnings Growth (yoy) and almost no debt has fallen so much? Rumors about a SEC investigation and an anti-trust investigation in Argentina.

Now, both of those things are, as far as I know, completely unsubstantiated rumors. First of all, there is nothing that points to a SEC investigation, second, Argentine anti-trust office is notoriously lax, even if it were to take action, LOMA would be worth far more of what it is now.

Honestly, its a bit outlandish, but right now, the only thing that makes sense to me, is someone is trying to tank the stock, then take over the company at a discount. I have been following this stock for a while, and I think this is just the moment to get in.

0,374,Real DD: Buy $SIG - Moonbound 🚀,"This stock is super underpriced for several reasons. Huge margin of safety. Huge upside potential:

- SIG dropped over 10% since Q4 earnings, despite beating on both top and bottom lines.

- Hampered by ""death of retail"" thesis that was prevalent throughtout the markets 6 months ago

- Other factors that applied downward pressure (which will likely be mitigated going forward) include sexual harassment / discrimination litigation (imo a non-issue - filed by class of 250 female plaintiffs, a tiny portion of overall company employee base), and worries over deteriorating credit and an overly inflated A/R book (they're in midst of restructuring, and recently sold off a lot of their A/R at only a slight discount, so the credit fears are more than priced in, and in fact, oversold - that said, the restructuring does cause uncertainty)

- Large short interest (25% of float) led to downward pressure and squeeze potential

- Strong and grossly undervalued fundamentals: 5.7x P/E, 11.2 forward P/E (forward P/E assumes worst case scenario and is still cheap), trading under 1 price-to-book

- Little competition in the budget-priced jewelry space. If you disagree with the dearth of retail thesis, SIG should be fine. Further, jewelry shopping is an area of retail that will always be done more in-person than losing market share to online

- If you look at comps such as TIF (which, albeit is more in the ""luxury"" space than SIG), TIF crushed earnings and jumped 20% when most people thought jewelry was dead. TIF trades at 40x PE versus SIG's 6x. SIG earnings on June 6 - earnings could potentially be the catalyst that causes a correction

- Management bullish sentiment - increased dividend (4% yield), share buybacks, CEO bought about $350k of shares after the 11% drop in Q4 earnings

- General bullishness on retail in general... look at the recent runs of some really shitty stocks (I'm looking at you FOSL and DDS), retail has been on a tear after being undervalued for a long time (sidenote: I plan on shorting both FOSL and DDS at some point when I can find a good entry)

I could see this hitting 60-70 by year end assuming the concerns are alleviated and starts trading back above ""distressed"" levels. I've been following this stock a while. The last time this hit the 40s in 2017, it ended up in the 80s within 6 months (before crashing again due to earnings and credit concerns). The last time I gave a bullish call on retail, it was when Macy's was trading in the $18s, and it subsequently ran up 60% in the next 3 months, and is presently up almost 100%.

0,402,Making Money from Addiction," 

Greetings fellow Autists. This is my first DD submission so I’ll keep in brief. 

TL;DR, 2 drugs related to opioid epidemic up for Adcom mid-Oct and FDA Approval early Nov.  I focus on Trevena ($TRVN) here. You may also be interested in ($ACRX). FYI the DoD is a big fan of $ACRX drug which is a lozenge they can use on battlefield. FDA has said they will take into account DoD objectives when approving drugs.  

Both are up significantly in the past month but have room to rise before Adcom. I believe these are multi-bagger plays but can’t predict their performance on the two major catalysts. Been a lot of selling on good news in biotech lately (or so i’ve been told always).  

Trevena closed at 2.17. It fluxed between 1.57-1.80 a bunch before rising last week and continuing to inch up with minor retracement.

I’m not going to pretend to know how these drugs actually work. I won’t even pretend to understand the market. My model portfolio is a rotating mash up of WSB DD from first time posters.

I do however know a few things about the FDA, CMS (Medicare / Medicaid) and the NIH (I used acronyms here to further demonstrate my expertise). I’ve had things approved by FDA, paid for by CMS and granted money for study by NIH so I’m reasonably attuned to changes and opportunities in these overlapping sectors of gov. 

Specifically I (and you) know that the **Opioid epidemic is a big deal.** Its such a big deal that the House passed a bill this week with special focus on funding to develop non-opioid alternatives to treat pain. The money in the bill isn’t huge but its a big **signal to other agencies like NIH and FDA to get their shit together and fast track the development and approval of drugs.**  

**Trevena ($TRVN) - Drug Name Olivo; Oliceridine (TRV-130).**

**Adcom: Oct. 12**

**FDA Decision: By Nov. 2**

Oliceridine is a “G protein-biased MOR small-molecule agonist that has been shown to exert analgesia with less respiratory depression and constipation than morphine.”  

Why its better than Morphine:

TRV-130 (Oliceridine) was comparable to IV opioids at pain reduction, but lower for vomiting, respiratory events (a big deal, people die because they just stop breathing), upper GI tolerability and constipation.  

**Why I think it will be approved:**

1. **Doctors seem to love this drug.** That is a big deal, to be approved it needs to basically be safe (or slightly safer than something thats not very safe) and have an actual demand from doctors who would utilize it. This seems to be two big thumbs up.
2. **The National Institute on Drug Abuse is studying an oral version of Oliceridine (TRV-734) as a potentially differentiated therapy for maintenance treatment of opioid dependence.** 
   1. **They are so hot on this drug they want to make an oral version to give to addicts instead of methadone.**
   2. PO: 75N95018P00541 Aug 29, 2018 if interested in reading.
3. **The Donald has his small but mighty fist on the scales of the FDA.** By swapping out career FDA folks for his flavor of sycophants he has increased the rate of drug approvals during his administration, making 2017 a record year. 2018 is off to a rocking start again. Now is the golden age of slamming shitty drugs through the FDA. This one isn’t shit so by that logic its a slam dunk.  

I have a big night of being cuckolded ahead of me so I’ll close here. If people are interested I will dig in further on this and on $ACRX.  Bring on the hate. Would also be cool to learn how to play this situation better.  I feel solid on the macro dynamics but not the micro trading strategy.

Taken directly from their website - [www.trevena.com](https://www.trevena.com)

# At Trevena, our mission is to deliver innovative medicines to patients and healthcare providers confronting serious medical conditions.

[Oliceridine injection](http://www.trevena.com/Oliceridine.php), our lead product candidate with FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation, is a next generation IV analgesic in development for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain.

&amp;#x200B;

Following this [link](http://www.trevena.com/trevena-pipeline.php) you can find the company's current pipeline. The drug in question is TRV130 Oliceridine. 

&amp;#x200B;

"" Oliceridine injection was designed to optimize opioid receptor pharmacology using Trevena’s proprietary platform to deliver an improved analgesic profile compared to conventional intravenous (IV) opioids. Oliceridine injection is the first G Protein-Biased Ligand at the μ-opioid receptor, and is in development for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain where IV therapy is preferred. 

&amp;#x200B;

 In February 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy status to oliceridine injection. This designation is granted by the FDA to new therapies intended to treat serious conditions and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial clinical improvement over available therapies. In January, 2018, we announced that FDA has accepted the oliceridine injection new drug application for review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act review date of November 2, 2018. ""

Phase 2 results

[http://www.trevena.com/pdf/Singla\_et\_al.\_J\_Pain\_Research\_2017102413-24.pdf](http://www.trevena.com/pdf/Singla_et_al._J_Pain_Research_2017102413-24.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

It is a lengthy read so here is the summary. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Results: Two hundred patients were treated (n=39, n=39, n=83, and n=39 in the oliceridine regimen A, oliceridine regimen B, morphine, and placebo groups, respectively). Patients were predominantly female (n=198 \[99%\]) and had a mean age of 38.2 years, weight of 71.2 kg, and baseline pain score of 7.7 (on 11-point numeric pain rating scale). Patients receiving the oliceridine regimens had reductions in average pain scores (model-based change in time-weighted average versus placebo over 24 hours) of 2.3 and 2.1 points, respectively (P=0.0001 and P=0.0005 versus placebo); patients receiving morphine had a similar reduction (2.1 points; P&lt;0.0001 versus placebo). A lower prevalence of adverse events (AEs) related to nausea, vomiting, and respiratory function was observed with the oliceridine regimens than with morphine (P&lt;0.05). Other AEs with oliceridine were generally dose-related and similar in nature to those observed with conventional opioids; no serious AEs were reported with oliceridine.

Conclusion: These results suggest that oliceridine may provide effective, rapid analgesia in patients with moderate to severe postoperative pain, with an acceptable safety/tolerability profile and potentially wider therapeutic window than morphine.

&amp;#x200B;

Also another lengthy read. 

&amp;#x200B;

 The analgesic efficacy of TRV130 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain was achieved without SAEs. Although proof of concept was demonstrated for analgesic efficacy, robust tolerability comparisons were limited by dosing methodology and modest sample size, and future studies are needed to continue to assess tolerability. These results also suggest CU for TRV130 at different points on the dose-response curve: Higher doses may provide previously unachieved reductions in pain intensity in clinical scenarios that require greater analgesia, with dose reduction as an option to preserve sufficient analgesia with fewer ORAEs than experienced with conventional opioids.

&amp;#x200B;

 In summary, this study demonstrated TRV130 analgesic efficacy in patients experiencing moderate-to-severe acute pain in a bunionectomy model. In-study comparisons to morphine suggest that G-protein-biased m-opioid receptor activation may enable increased efficacy with acceptable tolerability vs conventional opioids.

Now looking at older posts of $TRVN it seems like it hasn't been performing too hot. There haven't a whole lot of posts regarding this company in the past year. The most recent one was 3 days ago. Mentions of morphine being cheaper than this drug doesn't look like good news. It's going up against something which has been a staple in the medical community for many years.

Massive consumer response to AMC Stubs and AMC Stubs A-List as both beat all membership expectations

To better serve AMC Stubs and AMC Stubs A-List guests, who tend to book their tickets online, AMC is rolling out across its theatre network more movie-going convenience features like reserved seating and online concession ordering

AMC enables multiple A-List accounts to be charged to one credit card and extending plan eligibility to guests who are at least 16 years old

AMC is holding the line on A-List pricing for 2019, still to be $19.95 per month in 35 states

Beginning January 9, 2019, a modest AMC Stubs A-List monthly price adjustment to apply in 15 states and the District of Columbia

AMC reaffirms its $19.95 12-month price guarantee to all current AMC Stubs A-List members and all new members who sign up before January 9, 2019

LEAWOOD, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AMC Theatres® is excited to announce that AMC Stubs A-List will cross more than 500,000 enrolled members between this weekend and next weekend, eclipsing the Company’s membership expectations for the end of the first full year in just 4 1/2 months. Thanks in part to the popularity of A-List, the overall AMC Stubs program has surpassed 17 million member households, up from about 2.5 million member households only 2 1/2 years ago.

With the surging popularity of A-List which is also propelling more and more people to book their tickets online, AMC is taking further steps to make the movie-going experience more convenient than ever before.

Beginning immediately, households can use a common credit card as the payment method for separate, individual A-List accounts.
Also effective immediately, AMC has extended the minimum age for AMC Stubs A-List from 18 years old currently to 16 years old with a valid photo ID.
AMC plans to roll out reserved seating in all AMC-branded theatres and AMC DINE-IN theatres by June of 2019. This increase in reserved seating locations will not apply to AMC CLASSIC branded theatres.
Also by the end of June 2019, all guests going to all the AMC-branded theatres in the metropolitan areas of Boston, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, San Diego, and San Francisco will have access to AMC “Mobile Ordering,” which lets guests purchase their food and drinks online at the same time as they reserve their tickets, easily and conveniently picking them up when they arrive at the theatre. Mobile Ordering already exists and is functioning well at 52 locations in 24 markets around the country.
In addition to these added benefits for AMC guests around the country, AMC is holding the line on A-List pricing for 2019, still unchanged at $19.95 plus tax per month in 35 states. AMC is making modest pricing adjustments in states where the program is most popular. Beginning January 9, 2019, the monthly price of AMC Stubs A-List will move to $21.95 plus tax for guests in Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington state and The District of Columbia. The program moves to $23.95 plus tax for guests in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York.

Even so, all current A-List members as well as any new members who sign up before January 9, 2019, will continue to enjoy their 12-month $19.95 price guarantee from the start of their membership. So, to pick two illustrative examples, A-List members in Los Angeles who signed up in September of 2018 at a price of $19.95 won’t see any price change for their memberships until their September 2019 billing cycle, or those in New York who will sign up as new A-List members in December of 2018 at a price of $19.95 won’t see any price change for their memberships until their December 2019 billing cycle.

AMC will continue to operate its A-List program with transparency and clarity. So that A-List members can always know what they can expect with reliability and predictability, AMC hereby warrants that for all guests who join on or after January 9, 2019, the Company will provide at least 90-days advance notice before making any changes to their A-List program’s pricing or benefits. Additionally, reflecting commitments already made, for those A-List members who have joined or will join before January 9, 2019, they are assured not only of 90-days advance notice of any future change in pricing or benefits, but also that no such change would apply to them until 12 months after their initial enrollment date. As a reputable operator, AMC has no desire to whipsaw its guests with frequent change, nor would it do so without providing guests reasonable advance notice.

All other aspects of the AMC Stubs A-List program remain unchanged, including:

Up to three movies per week, in every available AMC showtime and format, including IMAX at AMC, Dolby Cinema at AMC, RealD 3D and Prime at AMC
AMC Stubs A-List can be used at the spur of the moment or also can make planning ahead days or weeks in advance possible, as securing tickets is made easy via reservations capabilities on the AMCTheatres.com web site, or on the AMC Theatres mobile app.
AMC Stubs A-List members also enjoy all the discounts and benefits of AMC Stubs Premiere, including free upgrades on popcorn and soda, free refills on large popcorn, express service at the box office and concession stand, no online ticketing fees and 100 points for every $1 spent for the AMC Stubs A-List monthly fee, tickets purchased for friends and family, and food &amp; beverage spending at AMC.
AMC Stubs Premiere and A-List members receive a $5 reward for every 5,000 points earned, which translates to a 10% credit toward future AMC purchases.
Adam Aron, AMC CEO and President, said, “In our minds, increasing enrollments to 17 million AMC Stubs member households over the past 2 1/2 years, or achieving initial enrollments of a half million members in AMC Stubs A-List in just 4 1/2 months, are astounding numbers. We have immensely successful programs here, and there should be no doubt, AMC Stubs and AMC Stubs A-List are here to stay with these programs’ structures and valuable benefits remaining fully intact. Our objective for these programs is that they continue to be both popular and profitable. Our decision to keep the AMC Stubs A-List monthly price unchanged in 35 states, along with only a modest price adjustment in some key markets going in place in early 2019, will keep us in that sweet spot of successfully balancing profits and popularity. We encourage current A-List members to tell their friends and families that our 12-month price and benefit guarantee remains fully in place for A-List members who have already joined or who do so prior to January 9, 2019. So, the program pricing of $19.95 will remain at that level for everyone and will be unchanged anywhere for a full 12 months after initial enrollment if moviegoers act now to become A-Listers.”

For information about AMC Stubs A-List and to sign up, guests can inquire at their local AMC Theatre, or at AMC’s web site amctheatres.com/alist or on AMC’s iOS and Android mobile apps after downloading or updating them with the latest app release.

0,443,Apple leads the decline of tech stocks.,"Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks turned lower on Wednesday as Apple Inc led a decline in technology stocks, offsetting early support from tame U.S. consumer prices data and a rebound in oil prices.

The iPhone maker's shares fell 2 percent, extending its losses for the fifth straight day. A raft of profit warnings from Apple's suppliers has fueled investor concerns that iPhone sales, in terms of volume, have hit a wall.

The S&amp;P technology index was down 0.8 percent, hurt by losses in Microsoft Corp and Adobe Inc .

Markets earlier got a boost from data that showed U.S. consumer prices increased 0.3 percent in October amid a rise in gasoline and rental costs, but were in line with expectations.

The S&amp;P energy index which had risen in morning trade on a rebound in oil prices, following a 7 percent plunge on Tuesday, also gave up gains.

""The markets never really left correction mode and it will be with us for a while, at least till the selling into strengths keeps happening,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.

An escalating trade war between the United States and China, worries about rising interest rates and slowing corporate profits have stalled gains for U.S. stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 trading about 7 percent below its record level.

At 11:41 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 159.75 points, or 0.63 percent, at 25,126.74, the S&amp;P 500 was down 16.07 points, or 0.59 percent, at 2,706.11 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 48.96 points, or 0.68 percent, at 7,151.91.

The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.6 percent at the open, reversing later in the day as all the 11 major S&amp;P sectors moved into the red.

""We would think if it were a sustained move higher, volatility coming into the end of year would be lower than 19 or 20,"" said Laurence Benedict, founder of Opportunistic Trader.

""People are forgetting that on Monday the market was down 600 points, basically we're trying to stabilize at lower levels.""

The CBOE Volatility index, an indicator of short-term volatility in the stock market, touched more than 1-week high at 21.20 points.

The S&amp;P utilities index fell 1.06 percent after PG&amp;E Corp slumped 22.7 percent on warnings it could face ""significant liability"" in excess of its insurance coverage in the event that its equipment was found to have caused the blaze in California..

Snap Inc fell 3 percent after Reuters reported that U.S. regulators have subpoenaed the social media app maker for information about its March 2017 initial public offering.

Given WFC's greater proportion of lower yielding assets, with rising rates, I'm not sure they will hold much of a competitive pricing advantage compared to their peers. 

Even if Q3 earnings are the highest for banks since 2008, there has been a net outflow of cash from the financial sector more or less all year. 

Even with WFC at a advantageous pricing, with JPM and PNC reporting the same day, I expect WFC to come up short, especially if WFC only reports inline with expectations.

Snapchat loses money per user. Less users = less money lost = higher stock price.

The only way to make money on SNAP is to long.

Alternatively, we get millions of users to constantly send videos back and forth to each other 12-16 hours per day and watch the DailyMail story over and over, forcing them to lose more money. This would obviously need to be a large-scale operation and we can't do it between 3 of us faggots. But I don't have any confidence at all in organizing something of this scale so you'll probably all just lose money with your puts.

I know it's a dying company, but these numbers are too good to pass up. Positive trends in the underlying business, namely nintendo switch-driven foot traffic will allow for earnings growth in 2018, and updated guidance from tax reform will be the catalyst to create a short squeeze from earnings in about a month. Remember how retail popped like 20% after tax reform? GME is the forgotten hero of retail.

GME is a dying business, but it's just not dying that fast. You can compare it to Sear's, seeing consistent double digit sales declines. GME on the other hand saw sales growth in 2017, largely from their-low margin hardware business, but also from new release games, collectibles, digital sales, game accessories, etc. that have more than offset the decline in the used game business, which by the way is dying, but at a relatively healthy single-digit percentage pace. MSFT is doing some cool backwards compatibility stuff with the Xbox One Plus that allow old games to be played with modern graphics and this could stem the decline of Gamestop's used game business. GME also has an AT&amp;T-branded store business which is nothing interesting and probably was a bad acquisition, but it earns money and leverages SG&amp;A.

Management has done an amazing job of sticking around in a dying business. There's a new CEO because the old one is in the hospital, which is too bad and hopefully he can recover and lead GME to the new golden age.

0,556,$RUN: Why you should buy the dip,"So I lucked out and came across a nice little stock called $RUN or Sunrun, a solar cell company that leases solar cell installations to home to make it easier for residential folk to get into solar energy. I decided to buy into this stock when it was at $6. It quickly grew and peaked (since my buying in) at $7.44 when the earnings report came out. 

They had a pretty rough earnings report and the stock price dropped as a result. However, I believe that this is the perfect opportunity to buy in while its low. 

Firstly, the stock has already started growing back yet again. Secondly, they recently became number one in residential solar in the U.S., passing Tesla's SolarCity. The past two quarters it has passed Tesla in residential sales.

It just announced its expansion into new states, which not only means growth compared to now, but also growth in the future as they continue to expand into more states. It is also good to remember that this was the winter quarter, and it makes perfect sense that solar companies wouldn't do too well in the winter, when the sun is barely out and you can't install in places such as the newly expanded Massachusetts since there is snow on the roofs. Now that we are moving into the spring and summer months, this is the time the company will experience a lot of people installing solar power. 

While Sunrun reported high net loss, they were lower than the previous year as well as almost doubling their net income and increasing their revenue by about $26 million. Since people reacted to the poor earnings report and didn't pay attention to the majority of good news coming out of this company, now is the perfect time to buy into the dip.  Its even been rated as undervalued, for example Credit Suisse set a price target of $15.

I'm running off 39 hours of no sleep and a lot of caffeine, nicotine, and adderall right now, so feel free to chime in about whatever in case I fucked up. And as always, buy $MU and $CRON

EDIT: Forgot to mention that Massachusetts is a meaningful market for them to expand their solar panel and battery business into since it is one of the states with the highest rate of power outages",2018-03-08 20:10:05,"['RUN', 'RUN', 'MU', 'CRON']"

0,608,Get him to the $GREK (DD),"I think there are a couple things here that are going to send $GREK, an ETF with a basket of Greek companies, ([my position](https://imgur.com/m3M6zq7)) to the moon.  Timetable: 3-5 years (if you want quicker gainz, you could always try options).

(1) The Greeks almost have their shit together. 
This summer they'll (hopefully) finalize the last stage of their [nut-busting bailout](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-07/greece-s-10-step-road-map-to-a-bailout-program-exit-in-august).  With the [Brexit negotiations](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-40788669) taking up most of the limelight this year, the EU might not have the energy/focus to squeeze the Greeks' balls. This could lead to a fairly favorable last stage of the package. Which could lead to tendies for us.

(2) I think that as the Brexit negotiations heat up and as talk increasingly focuses on the nitty-gritty of how the economic shit is actually going to work people will start to get scared and the Euro and Pound will weaken against the dollar. A favorable exchange rate will make Greek goods like [baklava](https://diethood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Coconut-Baklava-1-WP.jpg) more attractive, give their net exports a boost, strengthen their economy, and give us tendies. 

This is not the prevailing opinion. The ECB is [already winding down](https://www.ft.com/content/c276288e-f6d5-11e7-88f7-5465a6ce1a00) their QE and ""hints"" that their tightening will be quicker than [expected](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/12/the-euro-is-surging-and-experts-believe-its-only-going-to-stay-that-way.html) which has led to and will probably lead to a stronger Euro.  

That said, I expect the Fed to continue to hike rates regardless of what happens across the pond meaning any disruption in the ECB's tightening program will allow the almighty greenback to make gainz.

(3) Greek unemployment is high but numbers are improving. Sitting at a [20.7%](https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-greece-unemployment/greek-unemployment-at-20-7-percent-in-october-idUSEONI140S3) unemployment rate in October, there are a lot of people out of work in Greece.  Why is this good?  Because as their economy strengthens, those people will go back to work and put their recovery into hyperdrive.  What could go wrong?  That unemployment number could stay ridiculously high and less [baklava](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fWBmS9Ta9c0/maxresdefault.jpg) would be produced and we would see a weakening of the baklava/tendie exchange rate.

#*Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals*


# *Who Are They?*

Some biotech company that researches ways to get around potential antibiotic resistance. They create antibiotics to combat bacterial infections, including those caused by many of the multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.  This is shit like E. coli and Chlamydia which are resistant to some forms of current antibiotics because they mutate too efficiently (fuck you evolution).  So for all you degenerate hooker loving faggots out there, I guess its a relatable company.

They have been around for 12 years and their leadership team looks like a bunch of cucks, unlike Musk dady.  One of the fuckers is cross eyed, can't trust em.  So we have to divert to the science on this one.  


# *Over View*

They focus on synthetic variations of the Tetracycline, generating over 3,000 unique derivatives and creating a pipeline of novel antibiotics.  Essentially they are a one trick pony.  They seem to do alright at it, but they have the idea that their antibiotics can be used in oncology, but they are hoping for a stretch that really won't likely pan out.  So they focus their efforts on fighting bacteria that are becoming resistant to shit.  These drug-resistant bacteria are immune to the antibiotics society has counted on to treat these infections, causing a global public health crisis and what some have referred to as a “post antibiotic era”.  Of most concern are patients with bacterial infections that are resistant to many/multiple classes of antibiotics; referred to as multidrug-resistant (MDR), pandrug-resistant (PDR), or extremely drug resistant (XDR) bacterial infections.


Bacteria can be broken into two categories, Gram-positive and -negative.  You don't need to know what the fuck that means, just know that the company focuses on Gram-Negative which has been pretty much neglected like a red headed step child.  Gram-Negative (GN I will start calling it) cause most of the current serious infections in hospitals which is roughly 30% of all hospital infections.  Mortality is pretty high due to these infections being resistant to shit, so people just keep dropping.  


They license their tech from Harvard, so its gotta be working right?  Those Ivy League kids in Boston are smarter than those idiots at Yale in shit hole New Haven.  Anyways, Tetracycline has been around for 50 years and now this company is making it fully synthetically allowing it to be adjusted beyond anything that was done before and decrease the ability for bacteria to resist it.  

They use Tetracycline as the core structure and just modify the shit out of it like a Puerto Rican's Honda.  


# *Pipeline*



*Eravacycline*


Flagship product, treats life-threatening infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) GN Bacteria.  A Fully synthetic tetracycline antibiotic in Phase III for treating intra-abdominal infections and some fucked up UTIs, comes with a side of cranberry juice.  Luckily for this company, the FDA thinks UTI's are serious business and granted these guys both Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and Fast Track designations for both indications of use.  Thats pretty sweet they have more than one indication for one drug.  Two birds, one stone.
  

*TP-271*


Used to combat respiratory disease caused by bacteria and pahtogens. The FDA has granted QIDP and Fast Track designations for TP-271 for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, another two birds one stone situation.  Phase I though, so they are testing to see if the shit is safe, we will see later on. They have no news on this shit for a while.



*TP-6076*


Some investigatory drug they are running through Phase I to fight E. coli and a few other bacteria.  Lead candidate to fight a few different of the most urgent GN bacteria threats according to the CDC.  This one seems like they just picked one of the full synthetic versions of Tetracycline they have that they think will be effective and threw it out there.  We wont focus on this fucker, itll probably get through Phase I and be deemed safe like the other drug. 


# *The Real Focus - Eravacycline*



So this bitch is finishing up Phase III in two different studies, IGNITE1 and IGNITE4.  Eravacycline was investigated for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) as part of the Company's IGNITE phase III program which comprised of administration to over 1,500 patients. In IGNITE1, a pivotal phase III trial in patients with cIAI, twice-daily IV eravacycline met the primary endpoint by demonstrating statistical non-inferiority of clinical response compared to ertapenem, was well-tolerated and achieved high cure rates in patients with Gram-negative pathogens, including resistant isolates. The IGNITE1 data is serving as the basis of the Marketing Authorization Application  for IV eravacycline for the treatment of patients with cIAI now under review by the European Medicines Agency . In IGNITE4, a second phase 3 clinical trial in patients with cIAI, twice-daily IV eravacycline met the primary endpoint by demonstrating statistical non-inferiority of clinical response compared to meropenem, was well-tolerated and achieved high cure rates. The Company has used the results from IGNITE1 and IGNITE4 to support a New Drug Application (NDA) with the FDA for IV eravacycline in cIAI. The NDA is currently under review with the FDA with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of August 28, 2018. In clinical trials to date, eravacycline has been administered to more than 2,700 patients. Eravacycline has not been approved for commercial use.


2,700 patients is quite a few in the clinical trial space.  Typically clinical trials through all phases will at most see around 3500 patients, so hitting a number near 3,000 and proving both safe and effective is pretty critical.  Not only that, bu the FDA seems to be wanting to pass more drugs through the pipeline of approval since Trump's inauguration so this only improves the chances or approval.  They are seeking approval in Europe, which would boos the revenues from the product, but what we really want to see is FDA approval because all the profits are really made in America.  However, that European MAA filing presents a massive stepping stone for the company on their first regulatory application for marketing authorization and pushing them one step closer to market.  Using both Phase III studies which are showing positive results will likely increase the chance of approval by FDA.   Even further, Tetraphase is also currently conducting IGNITE3, an additional phase III trial evaluating once-daily IV eravacycline in patients with cUTI and, assuming a positive outcome, the Company plans to use the results from IGNITE3 to support a supplemental NDA submission for eravacycline in cUTI. In parallel, Tetraphase is continuing its efforts to develop an oral dose formulation of eravacycline. A phase 1 clinical program is ongoing which is designed to evaluate and optimize the oral dosing regimen for eravacycline.

The phase III IGNITE3 results show that the clinical trial enrolled 1,205 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive IV eravacycline (1.5mg/kg every 24 hours) or ertapenem (1g every 24 hours) for a minimum of 5 days, and then were eligible for transition to an appropriate approved oral agent. The co-primary endpoints of responder rate (a combination of clinical cure and microbiological success) in the microbiological intent-to-treat (micro-ITT) population at the end of IV visit and at the test of cure visit (Day 5-10 post therapy) were evaluated using a 10% non-inferiority margin. Responder rates in the micro-ITT population at the end of IV visit were 84.8% and 94.8% for eravacycline (n=363/428) and ertapenem (n=382/403), respectively (-10% CI: -14.1%, -6.0%).  Responder rates at the test of cure visit were 68.5% and 74.9% for eravacycline (n=293/428) and ertapenem (n=302/403), respectively (-6.5% CI: -12.6%, -0.3%).  Some good fuckin results, showing the shit is effective.  Top line reached baby. 

There are probably several of you retards reading going, ""What the fuck is a PDUFA?""  Well its called the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, essentially companies pay money to the FDA towards this shit and it goes into speeding up Drug Approval times.  The PDUFA Dates are deadlines for the FDA to review new drugs and they normally have about 10 months to review them.  If a drug is selected for priority review, FDA has 6 months.  This all starts once the NDA is accepted by the FDA.  This company filed their NDA back on January 2nd, and the FDA accepted the filing on February 27th.  So the FDA has a deadline of August 28th to give their response on the NDA filing, which was given priority review as well as Fast Track designation and some other shit.  

The Phase III data was positive, the primary endpoint was met.  Thats some good fuckin news.  However they are filing for two indications here.  Thats what the fuck is worrying me.  I have seen this before, they are throwing a handful of tacks at a board and hoping one sticks, kind of.  In both indications that they completed studies on, these homies find that the drug is not only effective at what it does, but it also is relatively safe.  Compared to other drugs that are already approved, their compound is found to be no less effective, giving this shit a good case.  


Second Quarter 2018 should bring Eravacycline (apparently its also called Xerava) to market on a global level, like I said Eurotrash countries and Murrica.  They are getting ready for commercial launch upon approval.  They are also working on developing plans in China having recently also submitted an IND to the Chinese FDA.  I bet China and Asia gets fucked hard by GM Bacteria just due to population and lack of excellent healthcare.  So thats a huge market for them if they get approved in Asia.  Anyways, yeah to sum up they will likely see FDA approval in the next month and Commercial launch in Q4 2018.


*FINANCIAL SHIT*

Now these dont really fucking matter for Biotech companies because most of them hemorrhage cash until they get bought out.  But here we go, a layout of their financial situation as of June 30th, 2018.

Cash and Cash Equivalents - $111.2 million

Shares Outstanding - 52.9 million

They expect their cash to last them through Q3 2019, so they wont be looking to raise any capital ASAP.  This is some good fuckin news for people playing the approval.  Unlikely to see a fuckin offering a day after or day of FDA approval if it does happen.  So you will likely see some of the gains hold for months following.  

Q2 reveneues were $11.6 million, compared to $1.6 million last year Q2, a real 10 bagger.   The boys did it.  Although, nearly all of it came from licensing to China which is dope because this shows they can license shit out while also get grant revenue from governments and also should see some revenues flow in following commercialization if the drug is approved Q3-Q4.

R&amp;D expenses are down 50% YoY, mainly due to completion of studies.  However, their expenses on administration are going up a few million YoY.  This is due though to the expectation of commercialization and the company preparing to rake in some cash money.

The company reported last week that they had a net loss of $9.5 million (-$0.18 per share), compared to a net loss of $31.8 million (-$0.83 per share) reported same time in 2017.  They arent losing as much money and are showing good data.  This is tight.


*THE MARKET*

Now you are thinking, how big is this fucking GN bacteria market?  Can some fuckin germs be worth that much?  Well, according to the CDC, antibiotic-resistant infections cause over 23,000 deaths per year.  Fuck, over 2 million people become infected with these tricky fuckers that resist drugs and a bunch more people die due to complications caused by the bacteria resistant to antibiotics.  

This market of antibiotic-resistant bacteria treatments was valued at $26 billion and is expected to reach $44 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 6%.  Thats a good sized market.



#*TLDR*

They make some drugs to fight bacteria which are antibiotic-resistant.  They have 3 drugs in pipeline, but only one we care about now.  They have just over 2 weeks until they get a PDUFA notice from FDA on a NDA filing, hoping to get approval in the US for marketing their drug.  They are seeking Asia, more specifically Chinese, approval and European approval as well in coming months.  They have two different Phase III studies that show efficacy as well as safety in over 2500 patients.  They show that compared to similar compounds, the drug Eravacycline is just as effective as well as maintaining a safe profile.  Shit is going for two different indications which is pretty cool, shows diversity but the FDA can be fickle so it might be possible that only one indication is approved, they change some wording on their studies and label, and I see them getting both indications approved.  The market for their drug is pretty fucking big, going to grow over $40 billion in a few years, and if you follow science at all you know that antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a growing problem that needs to be addressed.  Their financials are pretty tight, they have cash to hold them off until end of Q3 2019.  This is the biggest thing to me because the company wont fuck their entire investor base by completing a fucking offering and announcing a dilution to everyone the day of approval.  Their leadership looked dumb in their pictures, they seem smart though because some Harvard connection.  Didnt read about them after seeing a cross eyed fuck.  Their trials have met all endpoints and the company is prepping for commercialization which is reflected in their finances.  This is a good sign and it means they expect approval.  I do too.

My take - They receive approval for at least one indication by August 24th, although I wouldnt be surprised by both indications being approved.  Company looks solid, they have plenty of cash, are ready for marketing their compound, and are reducing debt and spending.  No reason for denial from the FDA in my eyes, no reason for dilution immediately, and their drug was designated Fast Tracked and Qualified Infectious Disease Product, meaning that the FDA thinks that this is an urgent matter and needs to be addressed.  They are likely to approve compounds that receive these designations because if it is safe and can save lives, they will try to pass it, especially under the current environment.  Stock seems to have solid consolidation around $3.00 long term, I would expect this shit to hit $7.00 by September honestly.  I like it.  I approve.  I might buy.


#*Way Too Long Didnt Read*

It looks like a buy.



#*EDIT*

There are comments around the massive drop in 2015.  They have been in Phase III for a while, as this phase does take some time.  But these guys ran 4 different IGNITE studies on their flagship product, and IGNITE2 failed to meet endpoints back in 2015 as an IV to oral transition therapy for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, and failed to prove that it was not inferior to existing products. While it caused concern then, they have initiated and seen success in more IGNITE studies, such as 1 and 3.  These have solid data, meet all endpoints, are safe and effective.  So while they couldnt get a hold of one indication before, it looks like they will for these two indications based off the successful studies.  I think that FDA approval is immanent due to the unmet market need that the company fulfills.  IGNITE2 might have failed, but the other indications are what we are seeking for FDA approval.  Also there are a ton of lawsuits going on apparently, if you check yahoo finance the page is littered with them.  Most of them are just reminders.  In my eyes, they are trying to cause alarm and scare off investors more than anything.  They are holding the basis that the company engaged in more patients in one of its studies to inflate the endpoint data in their favor to prove significant results while also lying about present data.  I doubt that is likely to be proven, so these lawsuits are insignificant. ",2018-08-11 23:07:30,"['TTPH', 'TTPH']"

Yext created a whole new market segment called DKM-digital knowledge management. They are a ten year old company which has been public for about a year. Going public allowed them access to capital which let them expand and win many partnerships this year including Yelp, TripAdvisor,Google and Amazon.  It's a simple product. On the surface they allow merchants and businesses to update the information that appears on search engines and review pages.  Under the hood it's a beautiful AI play with rich and complex ramifications.  The digital Knowledge Assistant interacts with companies and let's them know when and how to change their info. For instance if people are searching How many calories in a big Mac on their alexa, the KA will prompt the neighborhood Burger Restaurant to add the info to their website along with their hours of business and whatever else info is pertinent.  

-Management is stellar. Highly ranked on Glassdoor, recently named best place to work by Fortune. Keeps winning partnerships. Last big pop was a big win with Alexa 

-Expected revenue this quarter is 54 million ish. However, due to new features and partnerships I think this is a very conservative estimate.  Good chance of a big beat.  

-Last earnings call they mentioned a line about being worried about capital expenditures due to their spending on annual conference. Now they just announced David friggin Blaine will be entertaining them. Just an aside but I think this speaks as to just how confidant they are going into this report.

0,660,Covered Calls Income - August Recap,"Hello WallStreetBets,

&amp;#x200B;

Last month I created [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/95675f/covered_calls_income/), and I said that I would follow up with how I am sticking to my covered call only strategy. My goal is to make $500 a month off of around $20,000 to $25,000 in investments, which is 24%-30% annually. Although I cheated and played with calls and puts, I stuck to the spirit of my original post and only SOLD these calls/puts.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are [my trades](https://i.imgur.com/Ocyv0CM.png). I'll explain each one and plan what I should do next month.

&amp;#x200B;

1. KR Put **\[NET GAIN: $8.40\]** : I had money sitting around so I wanted to sell a put. I didn't mind owning Kroger at that price either. I made $8.40 lol. Put expired worthless and the strike was $29.00. I did this trade before I made my original post.
2. TWTR Call **\[NET GAIN: $145.35\]** : I bought 100 shares for $32.05 and sold a call with a $32.50 strike. Twitter shot up so I bought my call back and sold the shares. Unfortunately, I was in class and did not calculate this on my spreadsheet, and due to commissions, this trade cost me $19.60. I should have let it expire. Although I did make $281.55 on the shares, buying back the call lost me $136.20. 
3. KR Call **\[NET GAIN: $85.35\]** : I bought 100 shares for $30.05 and sold a call with a $30.50 strike. I let the call expire and the shares get called away from me. I made $39.95 (not official, this will happen on Tuesday after Labor Day weekend) on the shares being called away and $45.40 on the premium collected for selling the call.
4. MU CALL **\[NET GAIN: $115.40\]** : I bought 100 shares for $52.52 per share. I sold a $54.50 strike call. I collected some SWEEEEET MU premium, and I still own the shares.
5. CVS CALL **\[NET GAIN: $205.73\]** : I love CVS. I've been selling calls on it for a while now. My cost basis (not including premiums collected before) is $68.73/share. $69.50 strike. I bought back the call a week before expiry and sold the shares. Doing that made me an additional $80 so that was a good call.
6. AMD PUT **\[NET GAIN: 60.40\]** : $19.50 strike. I wish I bought calls lol.
7. MU PUT **\[NET GAIN: $36.40\]** : I had already sold my shares of CVS and TWTR so I had cash sitting around. I figured I'd sell an MU put and collect some SWEEEEET MU premium. Sold the put with a strike of $50.50. *I haven't really gotten into strategies yet, but I think this is called a covered strangle*. This contract expired worthless. Even if it had been exercised, it would have let me reduce my cost basis on MU (shown in #3).
8. IQ CALL AND PUT **\[NET GAIN: $63.80\]** : Fuck IQ I guess lol. My cost basis was $33.50 from a put I sold last month. I sold a $33.50 call (expired worthless, collected $24.40). Also sold a $29.50 put (got exercised, collected $39.40). Now I have 200 shares at $31.24/share (decent I guess). The problem with IQ is that it dropped so low that I couldn't get decent premium until I sold the call and put on the 27th of August, so the Monday of the expiration week.

\*ALL THESE CONTRACTS EXPIRED THE 31ST, EXCEPT FOR #1

For the month of August, I made $720.83. The problem is any idiot could've made money this month, even though my main strategy (covered calls) is used for sideways or slightly bearish markets. I am hoping I can continue to make over $500/month in the coming months.

&amp;#x200B;

I am considering using diagonal spreads to sell calls against, I need to research the strategy more. I am also considering buying 100 shares of $BABA and selling monthly calls (which is $500 premium for my chosen strikes) lol.

0,663,$MU to invest in city named Manassas... truly a WSB move," 

*— Micron        Technology plans total expansion of approximately $3 billion        and 1,100 new jobs in the City        of Manassas —* 

MANASSAS, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Governor Ralph        Northam today announced that Micron        Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), one of the world’s largest        semiconductor companies, will invest $3 billion to        increase memory production at its operation in the City        of Manassas, creating 1,100 new jobs by 2030 in a community        that has become a regional hub for technology and advanced manufacturing        industries.     

The City of Manassas        and the Commonwealth of Virginia        faced fierce competition against other U.S. states and countries like        the Republic of Singapore        to secure what the Virginia Economic Development Partnership        estimates to be the largest private-sector capital investment in modern Virginia        history. The expansion is also significant in that it marks the largest        project win in terms of increased exports for the Commonwealth and        strengthens Micron’s position as Virginia’s largest exporter. The City        of Manassas plans to work closely with major education        institutions like Northern Virginia Community College and George        Mason University to ensure Micron has a continuous pipeline of        qualified, technically-skilled labor.     

On the heels of the recent news that Aurora Flight Sciences will invest $13.75        million in the City        of Manassas, Micron’s expansion further cements the City as        one of Virginia’s most highly sought after locations for technology        companies. Manassas        boasts:     

&amp;#x200B;

* **Tenth highest weekly wages** and the **16th highest per capita          income** in Virginia;       
* **Fourth highest wages in professional and technical jobs** in the          Commonwealth**;** and       
* More than **20,000 people commuting into this City of 43,000** each          day to work at jobs in financial services, health care, homeland          security and defense contracting.       

“Micron's expansion in the City        of Manassas represents one of the largest manufacturing        investments in the history of Virginia        and will position the Commonwealth as a leader in unmanned systems and        Internet of Things,” said Governor Northam. “This $3        billion investment will have a tremendous impact on our economy        by creating 1,100 high-demand jobs, and solidifies Micron as one of the        Commonwealth's largest exporters. We thank Micron for choosing to deepen        their roots in Virginia        and look forward to partnering in their next chapter of major growth.”     

“For almost two decades Micron and Manassas        have been partners in the manufacturing of semiconductors and community        development, as the City was with IBM before them. The        significant benefits that the company brings Manassas        by virtue of their employment and investment help us make advances in        public education, infrastructure development and in maintaining a stable        tax rate for all of our citizens. On behalf of our entire community I am        thrilled Micron has chosen to modernize and expand operations here which        will guarantee the relationship continues into the future,” said Mayor Harry        J. Parrish II. 

“Micron’s Manassas        site manufactures our long-lifecycle products that are built using our        mature process technologies, and primarily sold into the automotive,        networking and industrial markets,” said Micron President and CEO Sanjay        Mehrotra. “These products support a diverse set of applications        such as industrial automation, drones, the IoT (Internet of Things)        and in-vehicle experience applications for automotive. This business        delivers strong profitability and stable, growing free cash flow. Micron        is grateful for the extensive engagement of state and local officials        since early this year to help bring our Manassas        expansion to fruition. We are excited to increase our commitment to the        community through the creation of new highly skilled jobs, expanded        facilities and education initiatives.”

This way, you don’t have to give a shit about which direction the stock price moves post-earnings, just that it moves at all.

e.g. SNAP trades at $12. I buy a $12 call and a $12 put, both with the same expiration date. SNAP earnings comes out and the thing shits the bed, and tanks to $10. It moves more than enough to cover the premium of both options contracts (one of which will expire worthless) and I get tendies. On the other hand, if SNAP somehow surges high enough, to say, $15, I still make gains.

L Brands has moved sharply downwards over the past two years as ""real beauty"" trends have pushed both retail competitors and institutional investors away from 'idealized' models and 'male-focused' lingerie products. This trend can only move so far however, and while larger sizes certainly exist, investors seem to have forgotten that Vic Secret holds a dominant brand and moat-protected competitive positioning in small-sized products aimed at younger women. The VS Fashion show is unrivaled among corporate names in viewership, and the list of names employed as Angels total a combined 100m followers on instagram. Additionally, overt feminist trends have stalled and begun to reverse in the Trump era.  

The stock currently trades at a tiny 6x P/E ratio, a number usually reserved for dead and dying companies. $LB however has posted 8% revenue growth its last quarterly, and has recently expanded into China with a huge flagship store in Shanghai, targeting overseas demand for American brand name products.

&gt;The iPhone has made Apple Inc. AAPL -0.07% and Wall Street hundreds of billions of dollars. Now some big shareholders are asking at what cost, in an unusual campaign to make the company more socially responsible.

&gt;A leading activist investor and a pension fund are saying the smartphone maker needs to respond to what some see as a growing public-health crisis of youth phone addiction.

&gt;Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, or Calstrs, which control about $2 billion of Apple shares, sent a letter to Apple on Saturday urging it to develop new software tools that would help parents control and limit phone use more easily and to study the impact of overuse on mental health.

&gt;Some have raised concerns about increased rates in teen depression and suicide and worry that phones are replacing old-fashioned human interaction. It is part of a broader re-evaluation of the effects on society of technology companies such as Google and Amazon.com Inc. and social-media companies like Facebook Inc. and Snap chat owner Snap Inc., which are facing questions about their reach into everyday life.",2018-01-08 10:45:39,['AAPL']

0,718,Mediocre DD for $TAL and why calls.,"First time posting a DD. 


The tickers are $TAL and $EDU both are offering educational services in China.

1. **TAL Education Group - $TAL**

Carson Block from Muddy Waters posted a short/bearish sentiment for $TAL on 6/13/2018.


**MAIN KEYPOINTS**
a.) Muddy Waters are claiming that $TAL has been fraudulently overstating its profits since FY2016


b.) Muddy Waters is claiming that 
&gt; $TAL is in decline and they're trying to cover it up, @2:00-3:15 in the video.


*I didn't make up my main keypoints, they're from the link.*

**link:** 

http://www.muddywatersresearch.com/research/tal/mw-is-short-tal/



2. **New Oriental Education &amp; Tech Grp - $EDU**


Back on 7/18/2018, Muddy Waters also posted a short/bearish sentiment for $EDU.


**MAIN KEYPOINTS**


a.) Muddy Waters claimed that $EDU has been lying on their revenue growth and financial statements FY2009-FY2011 (these were the years when a lot of China IPO's were proven fraud)


b.) Muddy Waters claimed that $EDU 

&gt; uses the upfront franchise and other fees to inflate its cash balances in order to receive unqualified audit opinions from its auditor.


*I didn't make up my main keypoints, they're from the link.*

**link:**

http://www.muddywatersresearch.com/research/edu/initiating-coverage-edu/



**Conclusion:** My DD is mediocre since I didn't pull up all the numbers and all. BUT after claiming that $EDU had fraud statements on July 18, 2012. *$EDU tanked more than 51%* and recovered after 1 year.


**Proof:** https://imgur.com/C0FwsUA


IF you've been following $TAL too, how are you going to play this? ER will be reported before August 2018.

It's new RTX 20xx cards look and sound dope. All that Ray tracing and HDR and neural net tech going into them sounds amazing, but the problem is (most likely) NO ONE'S GONNA BUY THEM.

They are twice the price of the current gen GPUs from Nvidia and most likely won't increase normal game performance by any more than 50% max. And it's doubtful that they will even get that much performance at all for most games. In addition, all of that new fancy tech is essentially useless for 99% of current games. The new Ray tracing tech decreases frame rates dramatically as well. (All of this can't be confirmed until the cards are actually released fyi)

The YouTube channel [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI8iQa1hv7oV_Z8D35vVuSg) has some great videos explaining this so check those out.

In addition, Nvidia's marketing of these GPUs has been straight up wack, and they seem very reluctant to release any real world performance numbers without doctoring the graphs or giving away too much info. Seems a little fishy... 



In summary, be weary of this stock. Once the preorder hype dies down and people actually get their hands on these cards I think they'll realize how overpriced and underperforming these GPUs will be for the average consumer and $NVDA will go dowwnnnnnnn.",2018-08-24 14:24:38,"['NVDA', 'NVDA']"

It's clear that the entire semi sector is being discounted (a stock screener and rank I run has MU, LRCX, AMAT, and ON in the top 10). However memory pricing isn't a death knell for semis, even if it is treated that way.

Micron can make up on any potential memory pricing drops (and have been and expect to) through increases in margins, sales mix, volume, and ASP. 

**Per BofA ML:**

&gt; We believe the recent share-price correction is mostly based on concerns of a downturn.
&gt; Our research indicates record-high revenue/profit. True, memory chip prices are no
&gt; longer rising, but this does not mean a downturn as cost cuts and sales volume increase.
&gt; We still model FY19-20 EPS at $10-11, which implies only 4-5x P/E and 3x EV/EBITDA.
&gt; Our $100 PO is derived from a 2.5x P/B (historical average 1-2x) due to high ROE (fair
&gt; P/E only 10x), and supported by DCF (8% WACC, FCF yield over 10% for the long term).

**Per JP Morgan**

&gt; Longer term, the company’s increasing product (DRAM, NAND, NOR) and
&gt; end-market diversification should dampen revenue/earnings volatility and
&gt; also position the company to do well in markets (handset) that require
&gt; multiple types of memory.

• Micron should benefit from secular trends in mobile DRAM that should help
it reduce volatility to commodity DRAM. Post the Elpida acquisition, we
believe Micron will be positioned well to benefit from secular trends in
mobility, networking, and cloud computing.

• New technology, divestiture of non-core assets, and cost-cutting efforts
should help it improve gross margins and profitability in the coming quarters.
Valuation

&gt; Our Dec 2018 price target of $84 assumes that Micron should trade at ~10x (in
&gt; line with the memory peer group average over the past several years) mid-cycle
&gt; earnings power of ~$8.40. We believe memory fundamentals remain solid in the
&gt; midterm, and management’s focus on improving margin profiles across business
&gt; segments (particularly in its NAND segment) should drive better profitability.
&gt; Above-average upside potential from current levels drives our Overweight
&gt; rating.

Another point, per u/cyphr0n

&gt; By SEC rule, a company cannot buy back its shares for a 5 week period which ends 2 days after the ER. This is why even though the buy period has begun in September, there are no buy backs yet.

**EXPLANATIONS:**

* Methodology: Avg.  of last 6 months actual results * [1 + (YoY simple growth rate / 12)] -- simplistic, sure, but probably still better than the non-farm forecasters.

* Source: [worldeconomiccalendar.com](http://worldeconomiccalendar.com/)

* I'm only planning to do forecasts for the reports that have a ""three bull"" rating. I also **WILL NOT** forecast crude oil inventories because it's a fucking pain in the ass. If you can't live without a forecast for crude oil, just look at what happened over the last few weeks, count how many times it beat v. missed, and expect the trend to follow whichever there's more of (although you should also consider things like weather, prices at the pumps, and so on).

* ""Red,"" ""Boring,"" ""Green,"" are just for fun. I try to base them on real information, but don't get it twisted: THEY'RE GUESSES. If anything, I'm hoping people will take them as a springboard for discussion, since we really do need more real-talk.

    Red = bad

    Boring = $SPY closes within $1 of its opening price

    Green = /u/MrTrader1's mom's dick

**WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT WEEK?**

5/7/18: Green

5/8/18: Boring

5/9/18: Boring

5/10/18: Red

5/11/18: Red

Guesses will be revised if/when news requires it. I don't factor Trump into my initial set, but as the week wears on, I do account for his dumbass shenanigans in my commentary and make revisions if needed. Earnings reports don't get factored-in, either way, because I don't have the time to go so in-depth -- and we've seen how, lately, they don't really appear to have much impact on the markets. Finally, no revisions after midnight or on days where my guesses are correct.

I think the main driver this week will be the Iran sanctions. Oil prices ought to continue rising, but the closer we get to Trump's ""will he/won't he"" decision, the more likely it'll be that people start taking profits.

Another driver is the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the trade war. If China announces new tariffs, expect the market to shit its pants. If nothing happens, though, expect the trade war question not to factor in so much.

Finally, Trump: if he says something retarded on Twitter (""More trade wars, boys!""), expect the market's dick to shrivel.

**Current record:** 10 correct / 15 total

$EXEL just beat expectations of $0.13 EPS by 192%, $0.37. $EXEL is a biopharm company that is marketing a number of cancer drugs for various forms of cancer and they are applying for various expanded applications. The company has $0 debt with $500 million in cash. This ER puts their PE at 27 with a forward PE sitting at 14.33, but keep in mind, this is likely even low since they have been delivering solid beats with a very successful drug that has barely begun to penetrate the market of the various indications it has been approved for. This is the epitome of a perfect biopharm to invest in. A reasonable valuation, an effective and expensive drugs that has not saturated its potential user market, a robust pipeline, and a very cash positive balance sheet. And on top of that, I think its is just pretty fucking cool that this company is marketing two of the most effective cancer drugs (Cabozantinib, Cobimetinib, and XL888) which they discovered and developed all in-house. I think this really is a great company to invest in because they have a track record of discovering effective drugs for treating cancer and by backing them you are probably doing more to support cancer research than idiots running marathons. 


I held a small position into earnings but I am throwing all my free cash into calls for this ASAP.

0,830,$UNIT: Is Meow the Time to Collect Your Free Money?,"Approximately seven months ago, u/CatsMeow83 (my cat-migo, and the founder and managing director of Pussy Powered Capital Management^TM), alerted you degenerates of PPCM's latest "" free money, bitch"" investment play.  It took the form of a longer-term bullish call on tower-asset management company $UNIT, which took the form of a fairly low risk buy/write strategy.  The CatsMeow was later banished by the mods, so her original post is included below.  

Though she hates you all, in her current catnip-induced hallucinations, she is apparently feeling unusually generous.  She has asked me to update her fellow $UNIT disciples on PPCM's next moves for this investment.  Without further meow, I present to you the current strategy:

$UNIT has come a long way in 7 months, surprising even the most bullish pussies.  PPCM originally picked up its 6,000 shares of $UNIT at a blended cost of ~$14.75.  This was always intended to be a hedged long play, and the strategy exploited the stock's near-constant IV crush by regularly selling covered calls to harvest premium and protect the downside.  These covered call sales began at the $17.50 strike price in late 2017, and then went rolled up to the $20.00 strike price in early 2018.  For those that jumped in with the CatsMeow, the call premiums, coupled with the stock's monster yield ($0.60 per quarter), should have yielded you a cool $4.70 in income per share.  The CatsMeow's current cost basis is around $10.05 per share.

The pussy predictive power has been strong with this one.  The stock now sits at $20.30 - and those of you still holding this money machine may be wondering, what is a savvy pussy to do with this position?  Take profits and bury them in the litter box, or ride this pussy-pick to $25.00?

Well . . . the CatsMeow continues to eye a $22.50-25.00 price target for UNIT, giving the stock even more upside from its current level, and giving you all even more potential to collect some free monies.  The stock has finally stopped trading in parity with WIN, which is a long overdue development, given $UNIT's successful ongoing diversification efforts, and its strong legal standing in the event of a WIN bankruptcy.  The CatsMeow also believes that WIN's current credit position (terrible) is likely to improve substantially (to not so terrible) in the coming months, after it receives a favorable decision in its ongoing litigation with its major creditor (vulture investor Aurelis Capital).  This litigation is pending in Delaware and slated for a bench trial this summer (the CatsMeow strongly believes that WIN will prevail in this action, as it did in the related ISDA proceeding, and ballparks WIN's changes of success at ~80%).  A victory will likely send WIN shares up to the $2.00 mark, and provide UNIT with some residual momentum that might take it up into the $22.50 range.

All of that said, the pussy instincts are strong with the CatsMeow, so sticking with UNIT in hopes of making more monies should be a strategy exercised with caution.  That's why the CatsMeow advises you to sell the Nov.16 $20.00 covered calls on your shares, which will yield $1.75 per share in cash premium.   During the interim period while smart pussies are holding their $UNIT shares, you will collect an additional $1.20 yield in the form of the company's safe quarterly dividend.  

So where does this strategy leave you?  First, it gives you $2.95 (14.5%) in added downside protection from $UNIT's current share price, so between now and the November expiration date, all of your existing gains are fully protected unless $UNIT slips below $17.05 (which the CatsMeow views as unlikely). Second, this strategy shaves another $2.95 off your cost basis (assuming your shares don't get called early), bringing your total $UNIT cost basis all the way down to $7.00 per share.  

So . . . if the shares are called away in November (as will likely be the case), the CatsMeow will bag $78,000 in total gains on the $UNIT play, and all of you that joined her in this pussy pilgrimage will be looking at similar gains in the neighborhood of ~90%.  All of this on a hedged strategy that offered investors some nice downside protection every step of the way.

Meow :)






**ORIGINAL POST:**

$UNIT: Come get your free money, bitches. 

This is as close as you girls will get to a free ride. Stock has been battered by a major selloff. It has been killed by its association with WIN (its primary customer). This is partly justified, but mostly unwarranted (do your own diligence). This stock should be at $25.00.

I have picked up 6,000 shares over the last week. Currently up over $7,000. I usually go with options, but I am buying direct stock here on margin (IB portfolio account) for various reasons.

To stay on a safe course here, I am planning to tap into the current IV and sell $17.50 covered calls on the Jan.19 LEAPs this morning. That will net me a hefty $2.70 share, or around $16,000. Until those covered calls expire (or the shares are called), I will be collecting a nice fat $2.40 annual dividend, which will throw me another $14,400 per year.

This one is easy money. You can thank me later.

0,847,Being a Meme Stock Bull during a Correction,"Disclaimer: I only buy calls on meme stocks. 

Last Friday, I decided to YOLO my last $1340 into one $TSLA $252.5 ATM FD calls. Monday evening, early ER was announced and IV shot up. Tuesday morning, rolled the call into two 10/26 $272.5 OTM calls anticipating that Tesla would break 300 that day. Then bought a 10/26 $342.5 call cause I saw WSBers posting big gains with their OTM $330+ calls, cause why not right?. After $TSLA bounced off of 299.8 a couple times, I tapped out and liquidated for $5,725. Fuck risking the 198% IV or theta. (PTSD) I was confident about ER so I decided to buy the max margin Robinhood would give me which was $3,000 and went all in on $TSLA stocks. 

Tesla of course beat ER netting me $1,100 but I got scared about the daily trade limit PDT so I decided to hold off til morning. Right at open Thursday, I sold all my shares at open (+$500) and rolled them all into 11/2 $315 OTM calls. As soon as I purchased them, the stock dropped 2 percent and I got margin-called in seconds. Calls dropped 2 grand. Couldn’t afford to cover margin so I decided to sell one call giving me that second PDT strike. Pretty blown that the stock didn’t rally that day but I figured that MM was trying to hold the stock down so they wouldn’t have to pay everyone til late Friday or Monday. Resigned to buying 2 stocks of $AMZN for ER. BAM. Margin-called again and so I sold one $AMZN stock ASAP to cover margin. Wasted my final PDT. Bought a SPY OTM SPY call. AMAZON decides to shit the bed and my SPY call became worthless. Dumped SPY and $AMZN at open Friday. TSLA shot up and I sold my calls for ~$3000. Bought a 10/29 spy OTM and 4 11/2 apple OTM $212.5 FD. Calls shot up 50% and my portfolio hit $9,370 but I couldn’t sell so I watched it drop to $7,900 for the week. 


My biggest dilemna today was to either sell $TSLA at a -1,000  so I could buy $APPL OTM calls when $APPL broke 213 or hold TSLA. I knew if I bought APPL, I couldn’t sell them so I stayed with TSLA. As predicted, APPLE bounced hard from $213 (-3%) to (0%).

My first experience with IV crush was in May for MU ER. I had went from 3,000 to $18,000 from TWTR, SNAP, MTCH, EXEL and BABA. Decided to go All in on MU ER. Lost everything when though my calls were ITM to OTM.

Last month, shares of Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals (ARWR) saw a year to date growth in their share price of over 400%, increasing from $3.70 at the start of January to more than $19.00 at the end of September.  However, the stock saw a large pullback in early October due to misinterpreted data and actions by the company.  On October 4th, Arrowhead entered into a $3.7B license and collaboration agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson's (JNJ) Janssen Pharmaceuticals.  While I believe this deal is the best step forward for the company, the share price reflects an investor sentiment that Arrowhead got the short end of the stick on the deal and the company could profit more in the long run had they kept the global licensing for themselves.  

*The Deal*

Under the agreement, Arrowhead received a $175M upfront payment from Janssen and a $75M equity investment at a price of $23 per share from Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation.  The agreement also states Arrowhead has potential to receive an additional $3.5B in milestone payments, as well as further royalties on commercial sales from Janssen as they received the worldwide exclusive license for ARO-HBV with the ability to collaborate with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals on up to three new RNA interface (RNAI) therapeutics against targets.  The upfront payment, equity investments, and additional milestone payments combine to provide Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals a total potential value of over $3.7B.

Broken down, the company is eligible to receive up to roughly $1.6B in payments for the HBV license agreement with Janssen, which stipulates a $50M milestone payment linked to one of their Phase II studies. Additionally, Arrowhead is eligible to receive up to $1.9 billion in option and milestone payments for the RNAi collaboration agreement. Lastly, Arrowhead is eligible to receive royalties that extend up into the mid teens in relation to commercial sales down the road. 

While Arrowhead has potential for large payments down the road and attractive royalties, Janssen does hold the worldwide exclusive license to the ARO-HBV program, Arrowhead’s drug candidate for treating chronic hepatitis B infection. Conversely, Arrowhead’s ongoing study of ARO-HBV will be taken over by Janssen for clinical development and commercialization.  This is great news as the R&amp;D, commercialization, and marketing costs will solely fall into the hands of Janssen while Arrowhead receives royalties on the back end.  Further reducing costs, worked into the deal is the ability of Janssen to select up to three brand new targets for Arrowhead to develop clinical candidates for utilizing the TRiM™ platform. Arrowhead will perform all steps required for developing the drug candidates, but the process will be entirely funded by Janssen up until the point the company is prepared to file an IND application.  At this point, Janssen can choose whether or not to take exclusive licensing on the drug candidate, if not then Janssen will hold responsibility for further development and commercialization. 


*AASLD Liver Meeting Presentation*

On November 12th, 2018, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals is presenting late breaking data at the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) Liver Meeting in regards to their ARO-HBV and ARO-AAT Phase I studies.

*ARO-HBV* 

RNAi has indicated potential as a treatment option for patients with chronic hepatitis B based on its ability to silence HBV mRNA thereby reducing all viral products, most notably HBsAg.

Fortunately there were no serious adverse effects or dropouts in normal, healthy volunteers or patients with chronic hepatitis B reported to date. AEs were mild and similar in occurrence for active or placebo.  Results showed that patients (n=16) who received monthly doses x 3 of 100, 200, 300 or 400 mg of ARO-HBV, 14 were BLQ (HBV DNA was present but below the quantification limit) for HBV DNA and 13 were HBeAg negative at baseline.

All patients that reached day 85 in the study were shown to have &gt; 1.0 log10 reduction in HBsAg with additional HBsAg decreases observed after the second and third doses. Of the 24 Chronic Hepatitis B Patients (CHB):


21 had HBsAg &gt;100 IU/ml at baseline

17 have currently achieved HBsAg &lt;100

7 ≤10

4 ≤1

In CHB with other viral parameters all patients have improved following ARO-HBV treatments in the following catagories: HBV DNA, HBV RNA, HBeAg, and HBcrAg.

ARO-HBV has been shown to be well tolerated by all in the trial. Results show that monthly RNAi with ARO-HBV effectively reduces all measurable viral products in patients, most notably HBsAg, making it a clear potential treatment for Chronic Hepatitis B.

*ARO-AAT*

Arrowhead is targeting Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a genetic disorder which causes liver disease in both children and adults. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a glycoprotein produced primarily in hepatocytes, wherein a PiZ mutation can cause improper folding of the protein and potentially leading to globules. An accumulation of globules can lead to a recurrent cycle of hepatic injury, fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and more.

ARO-AAT is a hepatocyte targeted RNAi drug which functions to halt production of Z-AAT protein, in turn preventing liver globules. In the study, 45 healthy volunteers were given escalating single or multiple doses of ARO-AAT or placebo in a round of 4 placebo:4 active, where patients received a single 35 mg doses of ARO-AAT or placebo. Multi-dose patients were also in a round of 4 placebo:4 active and received three doses every 28 days at doses of 100, 200 or 300 mg. Meanwhile, the study enrolled 4 patients to each receive a single dose of ARO-AAT at 100, 200 and 300 mg to assess single dose duration of response.

Again, fortunately for Arrowhead, there were no reported deaths or severe adverse events associated with the study to date. Single dose serum AAT mean nadir reductions from baseline of:


79% at 35 mg

87% at 100 mg

&gt;91% at 200 mg

&gt;91% at 300mg 

According to the company, ""Multi-dose mean nadir serum AAT reductions were &gt;91% at all dose levels with most subjects BLQ. Maximum AAT reduction across all cohorts was &gt;94%. A greater than 90% reduction was sustained for at least 8 weeks following the last dose in the lowest multi-dose cohort (100 mg), the only cohort with data of this duration."" 

In the study, ARO-AAT has been well tolerated at the highest multi-dose level and has indicated high inhibition of hepatic AAT synthesis, drastically reducing the genesis of liver globules. 



*Financials*

Without taking into consideration the $175M that the company is receiving, nor any potential equity purchases or money generated from the JNJ deal, the company has reported having cash or cash equivalents on hand of $78.1M as of June 30, 2018.  The company at the time only had enough on hand to fund operations for the next 12 months.  While this had previously caused concern for additional financing before, the JNJ deal essentially triples the company's available cash on hand and can support operations for greater than likely two years, preventing the need to do an public offering any time soon.  The company currently stands on solid financial ground with plenty of cash on hand as well as potential funding for additional research, potential milestone payments, and potential future royalties from commercial sales.



*Market*

According to GBI Research, approximately 350 million people worldwide are infected with chronic hepatitis B, leading to 780,000 patient deaths each year. 

Globally, the hepatitis B therapeutics market is served predominately by Baraclude and Viread, both of which have received black-box warnings from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This label leads the hepatitis b treatment to be considered being a market with a large unmet need.  The global market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.3% from the current $2.9 billion to $3.5 billion. 

Due to being very well tolerated and clinically successful thus far, the potential of ARO-HBV being FDA approved without a black-box warning seems likely.



#*Review*

I believe that Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals is a great buying opportunity at these current levels.  Investors reacted oddly in my opinion to the great news of the company receiving $175M in payments and potential for massive amounts of revenues exceeding $3.5B.  This prevents any short term financing or dilution that the company would have otherwise needed in order to operate moving forward.  The safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of the products being presented in the upcoming AASLD shows that JNJ was not mistaken in investing in this company.  Although Arrowhead could have likely garnered higher revenues and income in the long term if they had kept global licensing rights, the potential royalties as well as potential future funding of research is a great opportunity for this company to be able to focus financing on developing the other 6 products that it has in its pipeline.  I don't see a full logical reason for this stock to be trading at these lower valuations, I fully believe this is a steal under $15.

This post is designed to share my logic simply and transparently. Twitter down, Square up. Feel free to browse my post history, I have nothing to hide.

Thankfully, Jack is willing to whore out his children to the rest of us plebs through Initial Public Offerings. I've been balls deep in Square since it was young enough for the liberals to argue that my lust for it was just a quirk of my sexuality.   


Jack knows his kids very well, and some of you degenerate fucks may face a similar problem to Jack after you somehow succeed in reproducing.

Sure, you may look at the chart and claim that this negative correlation is not evident yet, but all it takes is this earnings szn to prove my point.  


TL;DR $SQ's earning action this upcoming report will inverse $TWTR's recently dumped report. $TWTR is the ugly diluted cum-squirt that avoids pussy and sports. $SQ fucks. ",2018-07-27 20:13:43,"['SQ', 'TWTR', 'SQ', 'TWTR', 'SQ', 'TWTR', 'TWTR', 'SQ']"

0,876,$PFE $ARTS $PRTK,"PFE: Treats form of non-small lung cancer (Drug: DACOMITINIB), Expected: **EOM**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85 percent of lung cancer cases and remains difficult to treat, particularly in the metastatic setting. Biomarker therapies dramatically changed the care of patients with metastatic NSCLC. Approximately 75 percent of NSCLC patients are diagnosed late with metastatic or advanced disease where the five-year survival rate is only five percent.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“What is most encouraging about these results is that patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR-activating mutations who received dacomitinib achieved a median overall survival of nearly three years, a marked improvement compared to an established treatment in this setting,” said Mace Rothenberg, MD, chief development officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “With today’s podium presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Priority Review granted earlier this year, we are encouraged by these data and committed to deliver this promising investigational medicine to patients as quickly as possible.”   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In April 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted priority review for dacomitinib for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations. The FDA Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date is in September 2018. The European Medicines Agency also accepted the Marketing Authorization Application for dacomitinib for the same indication. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

ARTS: Testosterone Deficiency (Drug: XYOSTED), Expected:  **September 29, 2018**. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Antares received a complete response letter for Xyosted that did not cite any questions relating to efficacy, manufacturing, quality control or the device used to deliver testosterone. Surprisingly, the FDA raised concerns that Xyosted could cause a clinically meaningful increase in blood pressure and might also be linked to depression and suicidality.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**The FDA Unexpectedly Responded to the NDA Resubmission with Lightning Speed; this is Highly Positive**  
&gt;  
&gt;In December 2017, Antares prepared for and requested a type A meeting with the FDA to discuss the CRL: this took place on February 21; 2018. The Company described the meeting as cordial. Antares announced on March 27, that it had received the official minutes on the type A meeting with the FDA. The Company said that based upon this that it believed that it would not need to conduct any new clinical studies to resubmit the NDA for Xyosted. At the time, Antares said that it expected to refile the NDA in 2Q, 2018. FDA guidelines mandate that the FDA respond within 30 days to determine whether the filing constitutes a complete response that addresses all deficiencies in the CRL.  
&gt;  
&gt;On April 5, 2018 Antares announced that the FDA acknowledged receipt of the resubmission to the Complete Response Letter (CRL) which Antares had submitted on March 29, 2018, earlier than the earlier guidance of a second quarter resubmission. Moving with unaccustomed speed, the FDA said that it considered this resubmission a complete, class 2 response and assigned a PDUFA date of September 29, 2018. The FDA had 30 days to consider the resubmission and my experience is that if the FDA has 30 or whatever days to respond, it invariably uses the full amount of time. It is out of character to respond in just eight days. This acceptance also takes away the risk and uncertainty that a new trial would be required.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Key Conclusions**  
&gt;  
&gt;This quick action by Antares in resubmitting the NDA just two days after receiving minutes of the type A meeting and the FDA accepting the filing as complete just eight days later is very positive.

**TL;DR; Buy $AMC $20 9/28 or 10/19 calls and wait for new A-List membership press release THIS WEEK.**

**Silver Lake Investment**

- https://www.silverlake.com/Images/Uploads/docs/Silverlake1409181248166028.pdf

- Silver Lake, a very TECH focused PE firm, **invested $600M** into AMC while Wanda gets to lower their holdings in AMC because they HAVE TO due to Chinese government mandating companies lower their foreign investments

- This alleviates a huge looming concern about Wanda selling on the open market. They've committed to holding onto the rest, saying they've satisfied Chinese government concerns, and if they choose to sell more, Silver Lake has said they will be the ones buying OTC

- Shareholders will also get a **special dividend of $1.55** payable on 9/28 to all shareholders of
record as of 9/25, that's an almost 8% dividend as of the current price. Expect a run-up in price leading up to the record date

**Competition**

- **MoviePass is absolutely shitting the bed**, announcing another [reverse split](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-17/moviepass-seeks-to-bolster-shares-with-1-for-500-reverse-split) and tons of people cancelling as see on /r/moviepass 

- Sinemia announced a $30/month unlimited plan but suffers from the same problem with lack of revenue on concessions and limited to 2D screenings only https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/17/moviepass-competitor-sinemia-launches-unlimited-plan/

- A trivial lawsuit has also been cleared https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/amc-settles-lawsuit-viva-cinemas-alleged-conspiracy-major-studios-1143574

**Fundamental Analysis**

- AMC displays short video ads for A-List on every screening which is effectively free advertising. They can also subscribe you to A-List and apply your ticket purchase to the first month right at the ticket window which is a great up-sell

- A-List allows you to watch 3D, Dolby, and IMAX which is what the theater experience is all about these days

- AMC makes huge money on high-margin concession sales. AMC is smart, they've done the math for A-List and they know that more butts in seats equals more profits from concessions even if they take a small loss from frequent movie-goers

**Movie Industry**

- The movie industry is looking to have a **record year**, no matter how you slice it on BoxOfficeMojo, the numbers are amazing every month, quarter, and year for 2018 https://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/?view2=ytdcompare&amp;compare=ytd&amp;p=.htm

- The reason for AMC's sharp decline in 2017 was primarily because of a horrible box office year, but 2018 had a monster beginning of the year, a record August which is traditionally the worst month, and a huge lineup to end the year AND an amazing 2019 if you pay attention to /r/boxoffice

- Just look at how shitty 2017 August movies were https://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=4326&amp;p=.htm

- The movie industry is also relatively un-impacted by trade war fears, consumer discretionary has been high this year and movies fall under that categroy

**MONEY-MAKER: A-List Growth**

- A-List launched on June 26

- 5 weeks later on July 31 they had 175,000 subscribers

- 7 weeks later on August 17 they had 260,000 subscribers

- If they continued at that same rate, they would have 430,000 subscribers right now

- Their goal was 500,000 members by June 2019 and 1 million members at June of 2020

- **HERE'S THE MONEY-MAKER**. The CEO on their [conference call](https://services.choruscall.com/links/amc180620.html) about the investment off-the cusp at the 15:50 mark said:

&gt; A-List really is on quite a roll. We're only 80 days into this new effort and we have already blown **WAY PAST** 300,00 enrolled members. We intend to put out the latest numbers updated for you early next week for your edification. A-List is a hit.

- The emphasis on **WAY PAST** was clear in his tone. And a press release this week announcing the new numbers. Investors love subscription businesses as that means consistent revenue and AMC is absolutely dominating the post-MoviePass world, just take a look at /r/AMCsAList and the number of people saying they moved over on /r/moviepass/ /r/MoviePassClub/

**Leverage**

- Moody's today has signaled they're maintaining AMC's debt rating despite the additional $600 million in convertible notes https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-says-AMC-ratings-unchanged-following-issuance-of-600-million--PR_389036

- This is HUGE because the reason for the dramatic dip on Friday was because of Eric Handler at MKM Partners downgrading AMC from Buy to Hold (while keeping the Price Target at $21) because of the debt concern. He was even the first person to ask a question on their conference call! AMC has traditionally had a problem holding a lot of debt but is working on actively paying it down https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amcs-stock-swings-lower-mkm-downgrade-follows-silver-lake-investment-special-dividend-2018-09-14

- Also the way convertible debts work, Silver Lake is almost guaranteed to want to convert this to shares thus it's not really debt in the long-term

0,952,Help on 2nd problem,"Since this is a WSB subreddit, I will put this in the context of MU.

In discrete-time, let the change in price delta_t = x_{t+1}-x{t} of $MU (x_t)be sampled from a distribution (t = time stamp in day). We plan to construct a model of our portfolio's as PNL(t) = n_t*delta_t, that our portfolio with balance at time t (PNL(t)) doesn't blow up (Probability that PNL(t) &lt; 0) &lt; 5%), where n_t represents the # of shares of $MU. We hope to maximize PNL(t) subject to the constraint that Probability that PNL(t) &lt; 0) &lt; 0.05.


An analyst provides some clues on the distribution of $MU's price changes.

**Clue 1:**
He notices that delta_t which roughly represents d$MU/dt is cyclical, due to the nature of memory prices. Specifically, empirical mean of delta_t over t = sin((t-T)/365).
Due to volatility near the price of $MU's peak and trough increases.
Specifically, the empirical 2nd moment over t = abs(cos((t-T)/365)).

Note that T is a time offset parameter known to us.

**Clue 2:**
An analyst analyzing Samsung and SK Hynix memory supply sees that Micron's price change delta_t is fundamentally related to Samsung's price changes deltay_{t-1} and SK Hynix's deltaz_{t-1}.

lim as c -&gt; inf of Prob( abs(delta_t - deltay_{t-1}) &lt; c*x_t) = tanh(c)
lim as c -&gt; inf of Prob( abs(delta_t - deltaz_{t-1}) &lt; c*x_t) = tanh(c), where c is a real non-negative number.

Finally, sometimes he sees tail-risk from goldman sachs.
The probability that Toshiya Hari downgrades $MU and thereby causes a binary movement at time tx of delta_{tx} = -0.5*c*x_{tx-1} is governed by:

Prob(Hari downgrading $MU) is proportional to sin((t-T)/365).

lim as c-&gt; inf of Prob( delta_{tx} &lt; -0.5*c*x_{tx-1} ) &gt; tanh(c)

Question:

What is the optimum allocation n_t if the price of MU is a (i.i.d.) gaussian random process for all c?

What is the optimum allocation n_t in general for all c?

Shout out to Andrew Aziz, Ph.D.'s book where I learned this

Stocks **similar but not explicitly** $GE **can** be artificially held up by a large financial institution

Large financial institutions L O V E to find a stock in positions **similar but not explicitly** to $GE: cheap, lots of negative news, by every measure this stock should tank, and they're not particularly influential on other sectors like semiconductors or media with lots of IP.

See compared to us retail investors, large institutions have nearly unlimited buying power (they don't, but I'll get back to this). They can buy a steady stream of stock to keep the price up. Later, they'll lose money on those shares, buuuuut they can make **MASSIVE** amounts selling Puts right now.

This only ends when a catalyst comes down to break their hold, usually another large institution dumping enough shares. Why else do you think **stocks similar but not explicitly $GE** can hover flat despite everything happening in recent company events and during tremendous market movement?

Now is this happening to **stocks similar but not explicitly $GE**? I don't have any inside info, but be aware this is a totally valid strat in the market, there are absolutely whales in this ocean looking to eat as many krill as they can with the smallest effort possible.

0,965,Tendies While the Market Is Downies: WSBers Guide to Playing the $VIX,"**INTRO**  

Alright, faggy boys. Now that the market is facing a correction, it's time to put away your mom's credit card you used to buy $TLRY and $AMRN calls on margin. Time to earn money like a real fucking man. Today, we're learning how to play the $VIX.  

**THE FUCK IS $VIX?**  

Now, you may be wondering, what the fuck is a VIX? The VIX is what's called the Volatility Index, tracked by many different ETFs traded on the NASDAQ. That means if you're a Robinhood fag, you can trade on a ETF to have more leverage when the VIX moves up or down. The VIX is also called the ""fear index"", because volatility means fear of potentially losing your hard earned tendies from mummy, right? It's also how expectant the market is of a sharp jump or drop in share values. Because of that, it's also a good measure of how many Prayer Circle posts for $MU I'll see when I visit this sub.  

While $VIX is a good measure of market sentiment, it's directly based off a bullshit number we know as Implied Volatility, or IV. Yes, this word has meaning outside of 'muh IV crush' memes. To calculate its price, $VIX pulls IV data from out of the money puts and calls with an expiry date anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 weeks from that day. That means it's /r/wallstreetbets proof, since you turds only trade FDs. The weighted prices of these options and their IV are averaged using such advanced math, that it may only be described as Magic Wizdaddy Shit. The general trend of the formula used, WSBers have found, is that higher volatility means a higher $VIX price.  

**IN AUTIST TERMS**  

Observing a graph of the S&amp;P 500 versus $VIX, we can see that the $VIX may be the only asset in existence where your autistic 'buy high, sell low' strategy works. Because IV rises during corrections and pullbacks, keeping track of large market moves is a good way to guess how the $VIX will react. This gives us an idea of what options to buy, and when.  

**CALLS**  

Unless you're sure that the market is going to take a giant shit, don't fucking buy OTM calls on $VIX, for the love of god. Theta decay will take your portfolio to pound town, especially during a bull market when average IV is on a general downtrend. Unless you want to be the next one posting a margin call notice from Robinhood to the front page of this sub, don't do it unless you're absolutely sure of a coming correction or bull market. If you must buy calls on $VIX, get in and get out. Buy calls when the S&amp;P is high, and sell your calls when the S&amp;P is low. Use limit sell orders. Overall, calls are a high maintenance, high risk strategy to take here, and are generally not worth it.  

tl; dr buy puts when the $VIX is high, sell them when the $VIX is low. Fucking retard.  

**PUTS**  

Puts are a much safer way to approach playing the $VIX. As with calls, you shouldn't long term hold your puts here unless you bought them when the rest of the full-time money losers on this sub sold their red $AMD calls, otherwise known as the bottom of the market. When the market recovers and the $VIX inevitably falls as a result, your puts will skyrocket and you'll be enjoying glorious Wendy's tendies through the next quarter.  

tl; dr buy calls when the market is high, sell them when the market is low. 

**CONCLUSION**

0,975,Weed stocks are stupid,"first off not done with this just have to save it so i can open it at home and finish it


How much weed do we really need? 


Start with some assumptions:


Say your average person in the US would consume 0.1 grams of thc per day. Yea yea some people use a lot more, 90% of profits come from 10% of users blah blah fuckoff. average is 0.1 grams per day. thats the equivalent of smoking 1 gram of decent pot per day. 


&gt;(Prevalence of Drinking: According to the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 86.4 percent of people ages 18 or older reported that they drank alcohol at some point in their lifetime; 70.1 percent reported that they drank in the past year; 56.0 percent reported that they drank in the past month)[https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics]

~60% of the us population is over 18, 

~60% of that using alcohol in the last month, take that as a base case for daily average users. massive overestimate but whatever.

35% of 350 mil is 125 million people  

now 125 million people using 0.1grams of thc per day. comes to 12.5 million grams per day. 

comes to 4.5 million kgs of thc per year. 

now decent pot has about 5-15% thc. really good stuff is 15-20%. so lets take the bottom of the bottom end cause were gonna go phillip morris on this bitch and do it industrial agribusiness style. with proper solvents and homogenization we will have a standard budweiser/marlboro like commodity product. 

so lets say 2% yield means we will need 230,000,000 lbs of pot. and that seems like a lot, right? wrong... thats 115,000 tons of pot/yr.  The US grew 350,000 tons of tobacco last year and 330,000,000 tons of corn. 

what the fuck is going to happen to the price of it when its produced like that? is it still going to cost 400$ an ounce? or is it going to cost &lt;10$ a pound. Most of it wont be high grade flower whatever at that price but the future of pot is putting it into food and drinks and vape pens and maybe pack of cigs, where they do the value added processing. refining it and homogenizing it into a proper commodity. 


so 230 mil pounds per year. at say 10-20$ a pound.  is a 2-5$ billion/year sales agribusiness. cgc is 10$B market cap. tilray is like 10B too. 


So what about the value added processing? at 2% yield per pound thats about 9 grams of thc per pound of pot. which is very low numbers but say you have to really wash it to get all the bullshit off and have it clean enough to pass regulations. whatever 2%.

10$ for the pot, probly another 10-100$ to refine it. and you end up with 90 doses for say 90$.  thats 1$ per full day dose, so you put maybe 1/5 of that in a 'beer', or a 1/2 in a time release pill, or 5-10 times that in a vape pen. yea you can sell that for 10$ per day dose currently, but once the flood gates open and its federally legal, whats to stop india from selling them for 1$ a day dose.

Even though it is undergoing a transition from consoles to digital platforms, the gaming industry has racked up some substantial gains in 2017. Stocks of major gaming companies have shown double- to triple-digit gains this year. Moreover, the exchange-traded fund (ETF) industry's first fund dedicated to gaming – the ETF Managers Trust Video Game Tech is up by approximately 50% in 2017.

Research firm Goldman Sachs, which recently began coverage of the sector, stated that video game publishers are ""in the middle of a renaissance."" According to a report released by consulting firm PricewaterhouseCooper (PwC), global revenue from video games is expected to hit $93.2 billion by 2019. The firm estimates that global distribution for digital games will reach $12.9 billion during the same time period.

There is good scope to improve operations like consolidate warehouses (each has \~30), improve organization in supervalu. Supervalu mainly sells to smaller retailers with higher gross margins - yet it had worser net margins. Think UNFI management can fix that.

There is an impression that UNFI overpaid for SVU - stock price was $20 when they agreed to acquire for $32. This misses the fact that most of capital structure of SVU was debt and the EV to EBIDTA was 5x. So the net premium was much smaller. Supervalu also owns lot of real estate - it's a shit old company that at book value was worth 1 billion.

In October, Danaher $DHR reported Q3 earnings of $1.00 per share. That beat Wall Street’s forecast by five cents per share. Previously, the company told us to expect Q3 earnings to range between 92 and 96 cents per share.

Back in July, Danaher raised its full-year guidance range to $3.85 to $3.95 per share. Which was revised higher. Danaher raised its full-year guidance to a range of $3.96 to $4.00. Working out the math, that means they expect $1.12 to $1.16 per share for Q4. Danaher’s CEO recently said he sees earnings coming in at the higher end of that range. 

**Check Point Software $CHKP**

Shares of Check Point Software $CHKP got clobbered when the last earnings report came out. The Q3 earnings were fine, but the outlook wasn’t so hot. For Q4, Check Point sees earnings between $1.45 and $1.55 per share and revenue between $485 million and $525 million. Expecting volatility on the higher range of the band. *long straddle 

**Stryker $SYK**

In October, Stryker $SYK reported Q3 earnings of $1.52 per share, two cents better than estimates. For Q4, they expect $1.92 to $1.97 per share. Stryker sees full-year earnings in the range of $6.45 to $6.50 per share. Forex costs will be about 10 cents per share for the year.

Stryker recently raised its quarterly dividend by 11%. The payout went from 42.5 to 47 cents per share. The orthopedics company has raised its dividend every year since 1993.

**AFLAC $AFL**

The stock will report earnings on Wednesday, January 31. The CEO said that if the yen averages between 110 and 115 to the dollar, they expect Q4 earnings between $1.42 and $1.66 per share. Wall Street expects $1.55 per share. For 2018, they see operating earnings between $6.65 and $6.95 per share. That’s based on the yen averaging 112 to the dollar this year.

Now here is the part where it gets interesting published January, 12 / Marketwatch

*Shares of $AFL umbled 7.1% in active afternoon trade Friday, although the insurer said a report that former employees alleged fraud and abuse was ""false"" and ""without merit."" Volume spiked to 10.5 million shares, or more than 6-times the full-day average. The stock, which closed at a record $91.69 on Thursday, pared earlier intraday losses of as much as 8.7%. ""Recent media stories regarding Aflac contain false allegations made by a very small group of independent contractors. Aflac intends to aggressively fight these allegations beginning with filing for their dismissal,"" the company said in a statement.* 

*A report by The Intercept said Aflac exploited workers, manipulated accounting and deceived shareholders and customers, citing multiple current and former employees, as well as three previously unreported lawsuits. In Aflac's response, the company said it has ""investigated these claims and found them to be without merit.""*

0,1045,[DD] Cenovus Energy ($CVE),"*Disclaimer: I hold no position in CVE currently, but have in the past, and I haven't decided if I'll start a new position in the next few days before earnings


Cenovus Energy (CVE):

&gt; Cenovus Energy is a Canadian Integrated E&amp;P
&gt; company with 281kboepd of production (lt/med oil
&gt; 11%, oil sands 50%, other heavy 13%, natural gas
&gt; 26%) and 230kbpd of refining capacity. Most of
&gt; the company's production is from oil sands
&gt; projects (all of which are SAGD - Cenovus has no
&gt; oil sands mining projects), but it also has sizeable
&gt; conventional oil and gas developments. Projects
&gt; are developed in phases with repeatable
&gt; concepts/designs.

As energy/oil stocks have been hit harder than most during the past few weeks, Cenovus has fallen nearly 30% based on no new information other than systemic issues with the sector.

As the price of oil has declined the past week and change (~10% drop), $55-60 per barrel of WTI is near the bottom of the economical scale that makes sense for oil sands projects. 

CVE though has a solvent-aided process (SAP) technology that allows it to be near break even as low as $45 per barrell, far below what other competitors would live at. This technology though is *just* starting to be put into place and will take several months for a full roll out, but should allow CVE to be among the lowest cost oil sand producers out there.

In December, CVE released its [2018 guidance](http://www.cenovus.com/news/news-releases/2017/12-14-2017-cenovus-s-2018-budget-continues-focus-on-deleveraging.pdf) citing several cost savings:

(2018 budget vs. Nov. 1, 2017 guidance)

Per-barrel oil sands operating costs – down 8%

Per-barrel Deep Basin operating costs – down 11%

Per-barrel oil sands sustaining capital costs – down 12%

Christina Lake phase G go-forward capital efficiencies – a 21% improvement (vs. previous estimate)

Total oil sands production – up 26%

Now a major negative is that CVE has taken significant focus in deleveraging their balance sheet. To do this, they've had to sell off assets. Obviously this will lead to lower net income, but it also means lower debt payments and capex reductions, leading to high equity value. 

On Friday, a worker died at their Christina Lake facility as a drilling rig was being moved. Though this may have had an impact on the stock, it's hard to attribute as the stock continued its slide in the mass energy selloff. 

After releasing it's 2018 guidance in December, CVE gained ~30% before giving it all back due to the systemic energy selloff. 

CVE trades at a FY P/E of 9.6x and a 0.8x FY P/B. It also pays a $0.20 dividend, making a current dividend yield of 2.6%.

CVE has beaten earnings expectations for four straights quarters.

The consensus price target (per MarketBeat) is $15.10, with PT of:

BofA Merrill Lynch: $12.50 

CFRA: $13

Morningstar:$16

Using the lowest PT ($12.50) would represent ~65% return from the current price.

Shipping with Amazon will still be in beta for quite some time until amazon develops the infrastructure to be able to ship majority of their products and until then they're still heavily dependent on USPS, FDX and UPS. 

Walmart is were all the poor people shop, I think they noted that their online sales makes up less than 5% of their total revenue meanwhile their same-store growth has increased.

It pisses you off that the your northern bros in Canada got the opportunity to play insane swings with options and make boat loads of cash while you slinged your dick in circles from afar.

Now recently, as in last thursday... Canopy Growth Corp. \(Amazon of kush\) got listed on the NYSE \(bumped it to $44 CAD under Canadian ticker $WEED at open\), the sell off was expected in this speculative sector as the run up was about 20&amp;#37; to the listing, so its down to $36 now and holding \(Rather than going down to its previous base that it held since janurary of 30\). Making it a great entry point. 

You still cant buy the NYSE version of Canopy \($CGC\) with options as the listing is too soon. However, there is a play for you guys to take advantage of with options... **ETFMG alternative harvest ETF.**  Is this the best option for the weed sector? No. Low volume for options and the top three stocks are not the top positions by percentage in this ETF. You can see the listing of stocks here: [http://www.etfmj.com](http://www.etfmj.com). Regardless it is an option... for options. 

June 7th is the final reading. Rarely in the history have things not passed during the third reading in Canadian history. Our supreme leader Trudeau ran on legalization, got the youth vote and its critical for him and his party \(which holds the vast majority seats at the moment\) to pass this... especially if they want to get reelected as their popularity \[after this image went to the shitter\]\([https://imgur.com/a/KFryDRe](https://imgur.com/a/KFryDRe)\). Cultural appropriation triggered the SJWs, he needs to legalize weed and put it in their system so they can forget it ever happened.

Since most of you are casuals and probably on Robhinhood, I thought it would be fun to write up a thread on some plays I’ve been thinking about for the month of April. I’m also drinking alone at home, so why not. These plays are risky. If you lose, you **will** lose over half (or all) of your initial “investment”. If you win, you could make a lot more. 

All prices I use will be the middle point between today’s closing bid-ask spread. Come Monday morning, these prices and values may be wildly different, but the theory behind my reasoning will be the same (assuming underlying share price stays around the same). I also may or may not already have positions open for some of these plays. I promise you I’m not trying to pump options prices or sell you overpriced calls. None of these plays will be on penny stocks or low volume companies, so I can’t move their share price. If I had that kind of clout, I wouldn’t be typing up stuff on this retarded subreddit. 

These plays will also be simple. No spreads or exotic options plays. I might save that for another thread if this takes off.

**Wells Fargo ($WFC)**
-

The play that comes right after this one is objectively better in almost every way, but I’m putting this play first because it’ll give you some insight into my theories. 

Wells Fargo and other banks (bar JPM) have been struggling really hard this year. Wells Fargo has been struggling the most. I consider this pick to be a badly cut diamond in a pile of other, slightly worse, badly cut diamonds. But here’s the thing with badly cut diamonds like WFC: they have really cheap premiums. Their options premiums are low because investors expect these companies to do poorly (because of recent performance), have low volatility (because of their generally stable nature), and/or are simply overlooked. 

WFC has not been stable this year. It’s down over 20% from its highest point this year ($66/share), which is a lot for a largely stable company, let alone a large financial company like WFC. Despite its downward trend, WFC has not fallen below $52 very often. Even during today’s huge red day, and other red days alike, WFC has a hard time staying below $52. This makes me believe that it has reached its bottom and that investor sentiment cannot realistically drop lower until we have more material information. 

WFC’s earnings report is on April 13th. When I see companies like these, where share price has tanked but then refuses to tank any further on horribly red days, I see a potential buying opportunity. Call prices are usually low, implied volatility is low, and investor sentiment is rock bottom. That means that even average news can increase share price. Above average news can send it flying. This news is coming up very soon and is a gambling opportunity in my book. Note that this is a *gamble*. You will most likely lose 100%, so put in only what you’re comfortable losing. 

* **April 13th 52.50 Calls**

These calls are stupidly cheap for an earnings play on a recently volatile company. An increase of 2.3% in the underlying makes this call profitable. WFC *today* dropped almost 2%. Personally, I think investors have overlooked this company, and its options, far too much. I think that average news will increase WFC’s share price to $54/share, which is an around 3% increase from today’s closing price. Anything more is great, but I’m banking on average and hoping for more. I’m also hoping for an increase in share price next week before earnings. The play here is to buy April 13th 52.50 calls. 

If share price goes up to $54, these calls will **profit 56%** (again, using prices derived from today’s closing bid-ask spread). If share price goes up to $55, these calls will **profit 160%**. If share price goes up to $65, near its highest price from this year, these calls will **profit 1200%** (unlikey to happen). 

-

-

**Financials ETF ($XLF)**
-

I was debating on whether to share this pick in this thread or not because I haven’t bought calls yet myself. But then I thought, who in the hell with enough money to pump up prices on an ETF this large would also listen to my advice? Anyway, this play is a variation of the play I shared above with WFC, but better (less upside, though with much greater chance for success). This ETF is impregnated by Warren Buffett, and other financial companies and banks.

The premium on these calls is ridiculously low. They’re low because 1. this is an ETF filled with very stable companies, so it’s doubly stable; and 2. sentiment among financials this year has been lackluster. But with earnings seasons kicking off on April 13th with banks, I expect this ETF to be extra volatile. It’s not priced for volatility because investors don’t think this earnings seasons will start off with a bang, but I think it will because I’m smarter than those fucks. 

* **September 21st 30.00 calls**

This play isn’t all-or-nothing. In fact, even if the play goes south, there will still be plenty of premium left in it for some semblance of recovery. But the point isn’t to baghold. What you should be doing is selling these calls come April 13th no matter what happens — unless you believe trade war fears will die down and the entire market will recover. This play *does* leave that avenue open to you. Still, don’t do it. Just get rid of it and move on. 

If the underlying goes to $28/share (~3% increase), these calls will **profit ~50%**. If the underlying goes to $29/share (~6.7% increase), these calls will **profit ~140%**. If the underying goes to where it was before trade war fears came up ($30/share), these calls will **profit ~220%**. 

The above values are rough estimates of what you could realistically see. They’re conservative estimates and on the lower end, so you don’t feel like I jipped you if share price goes up and calls aren’t as profitable as I advertised. 

-

-

**Amazon ($AMZN)**
-

* **April 13th 1500 calls**

The timing for this play has most likely already passed if Monday opens green. It’s also incredibly risky. It depends on a single green day early in the week, and if that green day doesn’t come, it’s over. I only put $2000 into these calls today at closing because the likelihood of this succeeding is basically nothing. 

We all know Trump hates Amazon. Share price dropped from almost $1600 to $1400 with Trump’s tweets coupled with trade war fears. However, $50 swings in this company’s share price is not uncommon. In fact, this thing had a $100 swing just this week, in less than 2 full trading days, before today’s tariff announcement. 

All I need is for share price to go back up to $1450 before Wednesday mid-day. If it does, these calls will **profit ~300%**. If share price goes up to $1475, these calls will **profit ~600%**. If there’s another $100 swing up to $1500, these calls will **profit ~1000%**. 

The above estimates are, again, a bit on the low end. Timing also matters a lot here. A 300% profit one day may only be 100% the next (with the same change in underlying).

**FORECAST**

Predicted (i.e. what I predicted): 178.6

Actual: 103.0

Predicted a miss. Got a miss.

0.3% was actually my first choice (ref.

**WHAT TO EXPECT**

Predicted: Red

Results: FIVE OUTTA FIVE BAYBEE :-/

I haven't looked at next week's schedule, but if I'm not mistaken, it should be a relatively slow week. However, be aware that a number of external factors have just whipped out their dicks, and are slowly stroking them, building anticipation for the moment they grab us by the hips, flip us over, and claim what's theirs.

* Tariffs. These will not go away. China is only the first country to counter our tariffs. Wait until other countries realize they can exact massive pain on us by levying their own. You guys know Mexico, right? Well, they just told Trump to quit being a dick or they'll stop collaborating. In other words, they're telling us to stop fucking with them or they're going to fuck with us right back. Trump doesn't want a wall to keep people out. He wants one to make sure he still has a cheap labor supply for his fucking golf courses.

* We just got our first hint of the subprime auto loan bubble collapsing. Several smaller lenders have entered bankruptcy proceedings in the last month. What changed in the last month? I can't boil it down to a simple answer, but the short of it is: turns out that, on average, people still can't afford to buy things, and the default rate is starting to weigh down the industry. And if you think they've hedged appropriately, you're the type of idiot who'd get a subprime loan in the first place.

""I'm concerned that we may not be able to attribute dips to overreactions anymore,"" is a complete fucking understatement. **STAY AWAY FROM WEEKLIES** and start shifting a portion of your portfolio to cash if more shit-meets-fan cues manifest. Don't forget to stay hydrated, too.

**ANY REVISIONS?**

N/A


**ANYTHING ELSE?**

To reiterate the way I do shit: I buy puts when the market goes up, and calls when it goes down. This strategy is fine if you stay the fuck away from weeklies, and don't mind being in the red for 1+ week(s). And don't bet against $TSLA.

Look for next week's predictions sometime tomorrow or Sunday.

0,1255,Some DD oil plays,"A few months ago, oil was one of the hottest things on the street.  Analysts were jumping all over pretty much every part of the supply chain.  Some oil stocks were up a lot.  Some of my minor holdings, $BTE, $OXY, and $CHK were up 30%+.  

Oil has since made a serious pull back based on basically three sentences from Saudi oil minister suggesting that the Saudis and Russians might agree to increase output.  There are a ton of reasons this might or might not happen, but a lot of the fundamentals that led analysts to be so bullish on oil over the next two years are still there - but the prices are much lower.  

For the very weak - move some money out of your Ally account and go buy $VDE, $XOM, $BP, or $RDS.A.  There are about 10 other ""safe"" oil majors that could be decent plays in the next 2-5 years too.

For the bold - go buy $BTE, $APA, or $SDLP.  These are companies that can soar if prices simply stay where they are.  $BTE is a $1B company that has a book value of over $2.5B at current oil prices.  Even at $60 WTI, $BTE is worth ~$9 per share and is trading at $4.

For the WSBers - go buy options on the above.  Use your credit card advance.  Get OTMs with 6/15 expiry.

Prices are decent because of the pullback, but the potential is still there for ""tech-like"" gains on many of these.  Don't abandon tech to do this, because tech could still outpace oil.  But if you're looking to ""diversify"" it could be a solid alternative.",2018-06-06 15:04:56,"['BTE', 'OXY', 'CHK', 'VDE', 'XOM', 'BP', 'RDS', 'BTE', 'APA', 'SDLP', 'BTE', 'BTE']"

0,1259,Recap: Day 1 of US Economic Results Forecasts,"[Ref. forecast for 4/9/18 - 4/13/18](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8ai65q/us_economic_results_4918_41318/)

Let's go over the results for today:

**FORECAST**

No ""three-bull"" reports for today.

**WHAT TO EXPECT**

Predicted: Boring

Results: I should probably define ""Boring."" When I make a ""Boring"" guess, I mean $SPY will close somewhere within +/- $1 of its opening price. Today, $SPY closed at $261.01 -- which means it closed $0.36 lower than its price at open. SO HAPPY MONDAY BOYZZZ! I'm right again!

**ANY REVISIONS?**

Based on my forecast, tomorrow's reports should either be meets or beats. No revisions yet.

**ANYTHING ELSE?**

I get that there's a fuckload of fear right now, but I'm under the impression that Trump has refocused on the newest shiny thing: the FBI just raided the *shit* out of his lawyer's office. This means it's reasonably likely that he won't open his stupid, fat gob about China while we're all trying to stop the bleeding. He's got other shit to wildly flail at right now.

Other things to look out for: China's tariff response. Don't expect the market to act like a little bitch this time, though. It might go red for a day (maybe two, although I doubt it), but we already know it's coming, so it shouldn't come as a shock unless our chubby little guys on Wall Street really are complete fucking morons. Here's the thing: China has more to gain by paying out more rope for Trump to hang himself. Why bloody your opponent's nose when you can tie a noose around his neck and goad him into running off of a 58-story building?

0,1260,[Serious] This is the week for gains in the financial sector. DD inside.,"TL;DR: I think there is strong possibility of strong gains to be had this week in the financial sector. Buy in by COB Wednesday to take advantage, and exploit using $XLF options or $FAS.

Thesis: The financial sector is one of the most undervalued in the market right now, and as earnings season begins I expect the market to finally give the sector the attention it deserves. Reasons:

1. The financial sector is tremendously undervalued right now when you [simply look at ratios](https://us.spindices.com/documents/commentary/dashboard-us-select-sector-2018-03.pdf?force_download=true). At 18.3, the financial sector currently has a P/E ratio that is not only the lowest in the S&amp;P 500, but [is in line with historical P/E ratios](http://www.multpl.com/), unlike many sectors right now. 
2. Earnings should be strong for a couple reasons. One of these reasons is that net interest margins, the difference between the interest a bank pays and the interest it receives, [has been expanding](https://www.nasdaq.com/article/jpmorgan-citigroup-wells-fargo-and-pnc-financial-are-part-of-zacks-earnings-preview-cm945379), possibly more than analysts have been expecting.
3. Another reason to expect strong earnings is strong economic fundamentals. The market has had ADHD recently with concerns about tariffs, $FB data usage, Trump tweets about $AMZN, and so on. Investors have lost sight of the fact that the economy is pretty strong right now, but earnings season will remind them of that. We have great job numbers, rising household incomes, high consumer confidence, and so on. These are conditions that lead to high use of the financial sector among both consumers and industry.
4. Another reason for strong earnings is this is the first quarter of earnings after tax reform. Enough said.
5. FAANG may finally be becoming passe. I realize as I am typing this that $NFLX is up 3.5% today (though on low volume) even though it has a P/E ratio around 232, but the market seems a bit more skittish around tech ever since the Cambridge Analytica news came out. Retail investors are being dumb and buying the bubble, but [big investors are very short on tech right now](https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/04/09/hedge-funds-turn-bearish-on-tech-giants/). (If you don't have access for WSJ stop being a pleb. Ask mom to buy you a few less tendies this week and get you a WSJ sub instead) [Valuations for tech right now are insane](https://us.spindices.com/documents/commentary/dashboard-us-select-sector-2018-03.pdf?force_download=true), and buying in right now seems to be typical WSB buy high sell low autism.
6. This week kicks off earnings season. On Thursday, [$OZRK and $CBSH announce premarket](https://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/earnings-calendar.aspx?date=2018-Apr-12). On Friday, [$C, $FHN, $FRC, $JPM, $PNC, and $WFC are all announcing premarket](https://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/earnings-calendar.aspx?date=2018-Apr-13). All of these are forecast to have improved YOY EPS, and some of them significantly so. P/E ratios for these are respectively: 14.14, 20.62, none, 27.41, 21.09, 17.86, 14.57, and 13.06.
More importantly, one year forward P/E ratios for these are respectively: 12.65, 17.49, 10.72, 13.08, 18.87, 12.27, 14.04, and 11.14. These valuations are as close as you can get to a steal in this market.



How to exploit:

1. Trade $XLF. It's a high volume ETF that tracks the financial sector of the S&amp;P 500. Of the banks announcing earnings this week, its holdings include $C, $JPM, $PNC, and $WFC. I would expect good results among these banks to raise share prices among the rest of the holdings of $XLF. Simply buying $XLF is the safe play.
2. Buy calls in $XLF. Pretty straightforward.
3. Buy $FAS.This is a 3x leveraged ETF tracking the financial sector. It tracks all of the banks announcing earnings this week, among others. It has average volume of around 2.3 million shares per day at a price of around $65, so it's big enough that liquidity won't be an issue. This is what I'm doing.
4. Buy calls in $FAS. This is only for those who play Russian roulette for fun. DON'T DO THIS.

For any of these methods, I would buy in the next couple days. With today's gains, I feel like there are decent odds of a pullback. Look for buying opportunities. In any case, convert as much to cash as you can, and buy in NLT COB Wednesday, and you will see sweet gains by the end of Friday.",2018-04-09 14:02:03,"['XLF', 'FAS', 'FB', 'AMZN', 'NFLX', 'OZRK', 'CBSH', 'C', 'FHN', 'FRC', 'JPM', 'PNC', 'WFC', 'XLF', 'C', 'JPM', 'PNC', 'WFC', 'XLF', 'XLF', 'XLF', 'FAS', 'FAS']"

Paypal is ending seller protection for payments made without paypal on ebay.

sellers not happy - 

https://np.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/84khz2/paypal_seller_protection_ending_on_april_19_2018/

Smart sellers will require buyers to pay with paypal if they want to be protected.  Ebay's paypal replacement is 5 years away so they have to deal with it.  Ebay is using their tax break to run a shitton of sales and drive more users to their site.  Ebay shot themselves in the foot with this breakup.

Is something like this priced in or am i 'tarded? (first post here btw)

[Recap: Day 1 of US Economic Results Forecasts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8b3g2w/recap_day_1_of_us_economic_results_forecasts/)

[Ref. forecast for 4/9/18 - 4/13/18](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8ai65q/us_economic_results_4918_41318/)

Let's go over the results for today:

**FORECAST**

**Core CPI (MoM) (Mar)**

Predicted: 0.2

Result: 0.2

**WHAT TO EXPECT**

Predicted: Green

Results: Not even close, baby. $SPY closed down $1.44, which means I can't even call it boring. First wrong guess. Mazel tov!

My record, so far: 7/8.

**ANY REVISIONS?**

Now would be a good time to revise my guesses for the last two trading days of the week. Unfortunately, at least as of the time I'm writing this, I can't get a good read on what will happen tomorrow and Friday. Futures are trading too close to zero. No news yet from the White House. No news yet from anything, really, so we're probably going to be left high and dry, with nary a tube of lubricant, until Trump Tweets about suitcase nukes at 3:53 AM.

I might revise later tonight, assuming anything comes up, but once midnight hits, I'm locking myself out of any further revisions until after the close tomorrow. 

**ANYTHING ELSE?**

[Yes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6xntziKoxY)

Back in 2016 after their first drug called Ocaliva was on the market, 19 people died, but those people were dying either way. PBC is a bitch. Doctors were giving bad doses, people were starting the meds sick as fuck already, and with better education between the company and the doctors, they'd have been fine. I imagine they've learned this. Basically, though, the drug wasn't what killed people. Nonetheless, investors freaked out and in September it dropped 50%. The company is still working on that PBC treatment but also, more importantly, a treatment for NASH. NASH is a currently untreatable liver disease that is common and growing across the globe, affecting 2%- 5% of the USA.

BlackBerry is a Canadian fall-from-grace hardware/phone manufacturer turned cyber security software company that peaked around 115$ per share back in 2008 and has gained 60% from recent lows to be now sitting at 13.78$.

In 2008 basically figured they were done, they were making Canadian headlines daily as they lost market share, but since 2008 it looks like they've been divesting, relying on some powerful income generating patents, while bringing an end to their hard-ware projects.

A lot of people lost a lot of money on this stocks run down / collapse but it seems like finally they've manage to end the hemorrhaging from running as a failed hardware business and are 'reset' to a small scale lean software business focused on being a leader in security for driverless/self-driving cars.

They've got a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 16.5 where the industry average is 47 and this is likely due to their reputation companies checkered history.

They recently got a bunch of contracts to implement security in cars for automotive companies and seem well positioned to continue and build on that as a foothold.

0,1387,Know what you're invested in - edition #1 JD.com,"Welcome to “Understand What you’re invest in” edition 1.0. These posts are intended to educate autistic traders about our most beloved category of assets, MEMESTOCK BOIS. This edition will cover one of my personal favorites, JD.com ($JD).


What:

 JD.com is an ecommerce sales company based in Beijing, China that deals in direct selling of consumer goods; JD does not have any brick and mortar sales locations nor does it manufacture any of its product offerings, all items are sourced from 3P manufacturers and distributors. JD also offers an online marketplace for vendors and consumers to host and purchase 3P merchandise. TLDR: JD is China’s “Amazon Lite” before Amazon developed web services and proprietary product lines.


Why:

 Two driving factors behind JDs potential for growth that we have all heard before; China’s middle-class is exploding and brick and mortar is dying. China’s urban household income is expected to double by 2022 (Mckinsey research). This will lead to a shift in total spending from the lower class to the middle and upper-middle class of Chinese households; meaning less of China’s total spending will be controlled by poors buying “needs” and more of China’s spending will be Alphas buying electronics, tailored clothing, household “Nice-to-haves” etc…


Let us look at the past 12 quarters’ revenue numbers to support this spending theory:


$5.9B


$7.4B


$7B


$8.5B


$8.3B


$9.9B


$9B


$11.6B


$11.1B


$13.6B


$12.6B


$16.7B


Estimates Q1 2018 15.6$ 


(B-b-b-ut Mr. fag trades, this is lower than last quarter!!! – holiday spending you dumb autist, this would be a 41.16% YOY growth for Q1.)


JD.com owns and operates 210 warehouses (~4 MILLION square meters) in China’s 50 biggest cities, as well as operating over 5,300 deliver and pickup stations. The distribution network is solidly established and DOES NOT include any storefront overhead.


Investor Snapshot: 
Market cap - $64B
Shares held by institutions – 55%
Short interest - 2.2%
30 day put/call ratio – 0.6
1 Year sales growth – 40%
5 Year sales growth – 54%
1 Year EPS growth – 104%
EPS growth forecast – 60.99% (1 year)


JD’s drop from all time highs resulted from a missed earnings in Q4 2017, where revenue actually BEAT. The miss can be attributed to JD reinvesting in itself:
“Despite posting better-than-expected revenue for the quarter, net income was down 17.7 percent at 449 million versus a mean analyst estimate of 666 million according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
In a call with analysts following the release of the results CFO Sidney Huang said smaller margins were linked to investments in new business lines including logistics investments, overseas expansion, artificial intelligence and cloud services.”


Reduced PPS also resulted from another $1B infusion from Tencent and a capital raise campaign of $1.9B open to Chinese banks and investment firms. 


Available ratings:


Market edge – long


Reuters Research – outperform


Morningstar – 3 stars


Concerns:


Alibaba competition


Potential to take on too much at once (international expansion, AI, web services, etc…)


Chinese economic downturn


Expensive by P/E standards


Disclaimer: OP Is looking for an entry for about $5K into LEAPS (2019/2020) but currently does not hold any JD. However, previous calls on JD have all been profitable so I am slightly biased.

0,1393,"Short United Airlines ($UAL), DD inside","2017 was a clusterfuck of a year for United Airlines. It seemed like they couldn't stop hitting the headlines with consecutive bad press. From [beating an old asian man](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2017/04/27/united-dragging-report-our-review-shows-that-many-things-went-wrong-that-day/?utm_term=.0fd81463637e) and [blaming the bloodied and bruised victim for being disruptive](http://deadline.com/2017/04/united-airlines-ceo-passenger-dragged-outraged-statement-1202067835/), to [forcibly wrestling a violin away from a costumer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2017/06/06/an-airline-tried-to-get-a-musician-to-check-her-17th-century-violin-a-wrestling-match-ensued/?utm_term=.1c487fc49491), just to name a few, they couldn't fucking stay out of the news. They also have the confirmed highest kill count of customers pets by [the US Department of Transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/2017FebruaryATCR.pdf) (PDF warning, page 56 for details), ultimately responsible for more than 1/3rd of all animal related deaths, injuries, and losses for all US carriers.  
  
All that being said, you would think that all hands would be on high alert to avoid any potential bad press. After all, doesn't the management owe it to shareholders to ensure high quality service is provided to customers? Lmao, **fuck no**! In just the past 2 days alone, United Airlines put a 10 month old puppy into an overhead bin (and killed it) and *then* put a different dog on a flight from Denver, Colorado to Wichita Falls, Kansas on a flight to Japan. The dog was without food or water (not required for the 4 hour flight), as well as medicine it needed for an infection, for the entire 16 hour flight. Articles by [New York Times](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/united-airlines-dog-death.amp.html), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/14/us/united-flight-dog-mix-up/index.html), and others are already making the rounds on the morning news and social media. The volatility, general unease in DC, and other tensions could potentially see this recent development in United's confirmed track record of fuck ups finally take a big chunk out of their share price.  
  
I recommend taking a look at different short positions to take on United in the future. Should you be wary of United turning its life around and being less of a shitbag? Historically speaking... it's not likely. ",2018-03-16 09:30:31,['UAL']

The problems: The biz fucking sucks. you gotta have an army of consultants (glorified salesmen) remunerated for biz they bring in. The issue is that the salesman take their cut at time 0 even if sub revenue is only coming in years + U not sure these folks are gonna stay. they invest half income into customer acquisition even though they are already a +10B revenue Co. you'd expect 

2. Peer review: there's only one we can seriously use and that's SAP

they have around same market cap, very close gross profit margins, but CRM's pretax margin is close to 1/5th's of SAP's WHILE SAP's REVENUES ARE \~\~3x of CRM

what about growth ? CRM/SAP PEG = 6+/3.5x don't be fooled by the raw figures, growth is cool but it's got a price tag like everything else

SAP Is german, could that be it? no actually being a german large cap tech firm SAP is about one of very few European hot stocks.

Indeed, SAP &amp; CRM are normally highly correlated but lately (see below), the relationship between CRM/SAP is bordering on 2stdev based on 200 days data

3. Stock performance

YTD this stuff is up 50% on a great 1Q growth beat which puts a hiiiigh barrier in front of them. it can go on but if it doesn't, people are gonna take their profits and crash the thing sensibly

# 4. My recommendation:

Option market  is pricing in a 1std move (meaning 68% chance this thing stays in the 144 to 158 range ASSUMING log normal distribution of returns, that's a big IF)

The whole point of my little exposé is that i believe there is a better distribution here:

The thing either falls a lot or goes up a little hence i recommend you buy the 141 put and sell the 155 call  

or if you need closed risk trades u can do 2 bearish put spreads like i did, it's a 5.5x'er

why 141/155? option OI makes this combo plausible for what we're aiming for here, see below.

I'll admit that I don't know (nor does anyone know) exactly what metrics specific HFTs use or what their algorithms are. However, what we do know is the volatility builds arbitrage opportunities. This is HFTs bread and butter. Just look at the chart of $VIRT since the end of January (beginning of market volatility). Albeit, you won't be able to get 100% returns in a week, it does require trust and their is risk involved. However, I think that $VIRT is a reasonable choice given the current

0,1491,$IQ DD Inside,"I saw a post somewhere asking for some actual iQIYI DD so I figured I would do some for myself as well to give myself some piece of mind on this new meme stock.

For all intents and purposes, we will use Netflix as a comparison, though as it stands, iQIYI has more revenue streams than Netflix does. Since IQ closed around $40 today, I went ahead and looked for when NFLX was around $40 and made a comparison between what IQ has for Q1 18' and NFLX Q3 13'.

(everything in thousands except price or if there is a unit)

(everything converted to USD)

||IQ (Q1 18')|NFLX (Q3 13')||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Price|$19|$44||
|P/E Ratio|undefined|68.88||
|Total Revenue|$757,510 | $1,105,999 ||
|Net Income|$(61,617)|$31,822 ||
|Net Income/EPS|$(0.31)|$0.54||
|Total Assets|$3,561,079 |$4,901,325 ||
|Total Liabilities|$2,235,974 |$3,696,955 ||
|w/ Shareholder Def.|$3,561,309 |$4,901,325 ||
|Total Paid Subscribers|\&gt;50,000|31,092||
|Revenue Streaming|$325,374 |$884,134 ||
|Total Revenue|$757,811 |$1,105,999 ||

iQIYI has had some incredible growth YoY and even between quarters, there is an article here [talking about the user growth](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/27/iqiyi-growth-accelerates-in-its-first-quarter-as-a.aspx). The analysts there suspect growth to slow down in the range of 42&amp;#37; to 48&amp;#37;. I went ahead and did a safe growth of 35&amp;#37;. This would be for Q1 19' and resulted in some new numbers:

|Total Revenue|1,022,638|
|:-|:-|
|Total Assets|4,807,456|
|Total Liabilities|3,018,564|
|  w/ Shareholder Def.|4,807,767|
|Total Revenue|1,023,044|

These numbers are essentially NFLX at $44 so from the book standpoint, it is pretty safe to say IQ is CAN BE valued around $44 if their growth holds up. IQ's current stock price almost assumes that growth has gone up 35&amp;#37; since March rather than a full year of growth.

Realistically, the stock should be priced around $30-35, but this is understandable as to why it is trading higher than where its American brother Netflix was at a similar growth period because of their new AI competition, board changes, and user growth. NFLX was at \~$63 a share when they had 50 million subscribers, IQ already has that many subscribers and its growing, and even more free users. They also make about the same amount off advertising with their free users which is great news and have other revenue streams and continue to make new partnerships and release news between earnings. Knowing where there are in comparison to Netflix as a baseline is great because I know that anything below $35 is an immediate buy for me.

Enjoy the numbers, correct me if I am wrong anywhere. I know my total revenue is different than what articles have posted for total revenue (e.g $777M) but I converted RMB to USD from their balance sheet. Currently long $IQ and looking to pick up more if it ever goes below $35 x (some genius IQ premium multiplier).

0,1511,Get in on $ATVI before you miss out.,"Alright here's my first DD so bare with me. I'm advising others to buy calls or go long on $ATVI.

**Technical Analysis**  The main reason for this DD is due to the falling wedge pattern that we can see [here](https://imgur.com/a/AnlqMXJ). What this means is that within the next couple of months you can expect a rapid increase in share price from $ATVI. 

If you draw a wedge by connecting the multiple swing highs with a trendline, and you connect the swing lows with another trendline, you'll be able to see our first breakout pattern from $ATVI since the current share price has moved above the upper trendline around the $70.76 mark. 

**eSports, Call of Duty, Blizzard, Holidays**
Rise of eSports: If we take a look at [this data](https://imgur.com/a/fpwd3IR) provided by Statista we can see the rise in eSports is rapidly growing and is expected to double by 2020 if current trends keep up. Keep in mind that Activision Blizzard owns rights to Call of Duty and Overwatch which have a fairly decent stake in the eSports market, although they aren't the behemoths that Fortnite and MOBA's still are today.

**But Battle Royale is rising?**
By taking a look at [Google Trends vs $ATVI stock](https://imgur.com/a/d0mqrDL) we can see that an increase in Battle Royale google searches implies slight bumps in the $ATVI stock. Although these are quite minor, they are worth taking note of since Black Ops 4 announced the addition of a Battle Royale mode and is set to release in October. Tie this in with Call of Duty's current position in the eSports demographic (which is small), and we can make a reasonable argument that the stock will rise significantly within the fall.

**Blizzcon**
Activision is having their annual [Blizzcon](https://blizzcon.com/en-us/) event on November 2-3, 2018. There is a lot of speculation within the community about whether they will be adding a new Diablo to the franchise, here's why:

World of Warcraft: Battle For Azeroth will have already launched by the time Blizzcon happens. So unless they're willing to reveal the next expansion only 3 months into Battle for Azeroth, World of Warcraft won't have much of a presence at Blizzcon outside previewing the first major patch.

Starcraft II is finished, and they just launched Starcraft Remastered not long ago.

Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm are competitive multiplayer games that will probably just get map / hero / game mode updates as time goes on.

So that leaves Diablo for the big announcement, the only game among the lot in a prime position to have a big presence at Blizzcon. It might be a Diablo 4 announcement, it might be a Diablo II Remastered announcement, it might be both, we still don't really know yet but it's something to consider.

0,1554,A company you should keep an eye on ($MAXR),"MAXR, I believe, is an undervalued company with great potential to blow up again within the coming year. It's currently sitting at $31 stock price but has future cash flow is valued to be around $64 in the next 12 months. It's annual earnings growth is expected to be 29.3% compared to the 16.1% market average and 13.1% growth of the aerospace market itself. 

Even though its been on a down-term of recent, employees within the company see it as [buy](https://imgur.com/a/fZCKdM3) (the top 4 have purchased 35,000 shares), and analysts are setting it as a [strong buy](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/maxr/price-target). Out of the 60.8 mil shares owned, institutions own 60.5 mil of those shares with only 300k shares owned by individuals. The employee growth has also increased from 4,800 at the beginning of Jan 2017 to 6,400 beginning of Jan 2018.
 
So why is MAXR such a low stock anyways?
 
Well, that's because its past performance has not been great, they changed over a new management team that have an average tenure of 2.3 years. Additionally it has a debt of 3.19 bil compared to its net worth (equity) of 2.12 bil, but the good news is that the gap has begun to to close within the past 6 months.

I'm still trying to understand the market as I'm 1.5 months into trading and I've decided to start researching a little bit more than just buying the hot new meme stock which I'm still addicted to (RIP my FB Calls today). I don't know if MAXR will pan out like I or professional analysts think it will, but It looks good and will continue to keep an eye on it.

0,1569,($SAM) Let's talk about booze.,"Alright, fuckers. I posted a bit ago on the ""the stock market is crashing omg hold cash and ally savings accounts"" subreddits about this, but wanted to toss some DD towards everyone else about a sector that I'm sure most of us are not in: booze.    

There are a few players overall in the space, but overall after checking out the major players, earlier this year I ended up landing on $SAM.   

**Finances:**    

- They're sitting on ~$76m in cash, which is important for a point later here.   

- Missed EPS estimates last quarter, mostly due to an increase in OpEx.

- Rev stream still looks to be growing + be fine overall.    

- P/E higher than the dumbshit Craft Brewer's Alliance, but is literally 1/2 of Anheuser Busch.     
    

**Bullish indicators:**    

- New CEO: Dave Burwick (formerly of Peet's Coffee) took the reins earlier this year and is running the shop there currently. Burwick previously had a history with Peet's for acquiring smaller companies to add to the Peet's brand overall, which helped their company significantly. With their cash on hand + Burwick joining the team, I'm very much expecting $SAM to start branching even further and start working on becoming a solid ""umbrella"" for multiple brands. They've already acquired a few companies + have developed a few in-house to capitalize on some specific markets.     

- New Markets: $SAM owns Angry Orchard (doing great, but not my focus here) and Truly Hard Seltzer. As far as short term plays go, this is where the money is on this one. $SAM has admitted that their actual beer brand itself has been suffering overall... but has been offset significantly by the Angry Orchard + Truly Brands. With it being summer, we've seen a significant increase in purchases + interest of hard seltzer overall, and with $SAM's distribution ring they're pretty much on every shelf that sells it.  This is a huge market as far as the booze industry goes that's literally just developing and Truly is towards the top as far as primary brands go.    

- Depletions: Usually something you only worry about with mining companies, $SAM has had insanely significant increases in their depletions (how long beer sits in their facilities before it's sent to a distributor). This was a big issue last year when they were apparently fucking around and not giving a shit about it, but we're looking at a depletion rate ~11% better than the same quarter last year. This is huge.    

- Sponsorships: One of the reasons I'm suspecting that OpEx increased last quarter significantly was due to the new sponsorship of the Boston Red Sox. Remember the Budweiser shit in the back of Fenway? Yeah, that's fucking gone and is now Sam Adams until at least 2028. They also run the show as far as pushing their brands in the stadium itself.    

- Investing in ""competitors"": Boston Beer offers investments + coaching for smaller breweries, which they pull profit long-term on. Huge for the industry but also great as far as profit goes for the company itself. Win/win.    

- Year's worth of supplies: These fuckers literally could stop getting the supplies to brew their beer and could make more for about a year. Literally insanity but it's awesome and they also did the industry itself a solid by selling hops to smaller breweries at market price from their reserves when there was a market shortage.

**Questionable indicators:**    

- CMO leaving: This could be good or bad. Basically the CMO fucked off who made the ""Fill your glass"" marketing campaign for them. Hopefully they'll grab someone who can be better than that campaign.   

- This OpEx bullshit: literally did not see it coming last quarter so I'm hoping they have it figured out this time around.    

**Bearish things:**    
- AB + other big macros are trying to expand: tons of competition in identifying good buys as far as smaller breweries go, and it's tough to compete with the capital AB has. That said, ideally from a product perspective $SAM can have leverage here on keeping shit not god awful.    

**Conclusion:   **

$SAM is insanely undervalued and I expect some firms that currently have stakes to continue increasing them, as it will continue to trend up. Buy the fuck in and ride up on a lower volume/volatility stock to balance out your MU $90 calls.    

**Disclaimer:**    

I'm long $SAM via a large position + am leveraging with call options.    

Also I'm drunk on Oktoberfest right now.

The aforementioned AML and CML have very common chromosomal translocations – one of the reliable ones was the BCR-ABL fusion – which lead to the so called Philadelphia chromosome – and the huge success of Gleevec. Myoproliferative neoplasms don’t seem to have those huge rearrangements. Recent sequencing studies have pointed towards FLT3, JAK2, MPL, and RAS mutations being associated – but so far they haven’t proven to be great targets. RAS has never been a good target, despite being one of, if not the first oncogene discovered. Imeltestat targets Telomerase. I’m not going too in depth about telomeres, however consistent proliferation of these cells (aka cancer), will lead to the telomeres eventually disappearing. So the cancer’s have to “learn” how to turn Telomerase back on if they want to keep proliferating. Imeltestat prevents telomerase from doing its deal. 

&amp;#x200B;

The downside to Geron are that they are a 1 trick pony. All their eggs so to speak are in the Imeltestat basket along with their partnership with JnJ (albeit 100 mill in bank). I don’t think targeting telomerase will “cure” these neoplasms or contribute to PFS in any meaningful way. However, it could lead to really good extension of life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Imeltestat is on JnJ’s current list of compassionate use drugs – which is a good sign. Anyways, JnJ will have to give their decision soon – which will be a 65 million dollar payment, and then structured rewards of up to 800 based on the clinical trials. On the down side, Imeltestat has been associated with a shit ton of adverse events. 

&amp;#x200B;

If JnJ decides to not pick up the partnership, expect the stock to crater. The IV is huge for the options, so you’re looking at a huge move in order to make any money. However, this is prime WSB Yolo material. Its going to be at either +50% or -80% within 2 weeks. I’m buying stonk, and puts at $5 for some semblance of downside protection.

**Omeros $OMER** – Strong buy short term and long. 

I find tons to like in this company. They really have a ton in the pipeline with a bunch of different diseases, which is really unusual. They have several shots on goal for their most developed lead, OMS721 (aka trials in several different disease spaces). They should have some data coming soon on the IgA Nephropathy – which is a very common kidney disease. OMS721 targets a portion of the innate immune system as opposed to the adaptive immune system (the one you hear most commonly about).   This is a Phase III trial, so you would expect a big pop if it looks good.  

&amp;#x200B;

I’m really a big fan of their pipeline. PDE7 and PDE10 are both really interesting targets. Dart Neuro - prior to their folding - was really a PDE10 company, and there is a lot of literature that backs up PDE10 being a potential treatment for Alzheimers. Also given that PDE10 inhibition doesn't work on anything specifically with Alzheimers, I'm guessing we'll get a ton of off label boomers using it.  PDE7 I think is a little more exciting. It is mainly present in both Immune cells and Neurons, and its activation can cause neuroinflammation. There is some good evidence that PDE7 inhibition can help with both Alcoholism and Opiod addiction, a space that has significant unmet needs. They are targeting movement disorders as well (AKA parkinsons), which I find a little quizzical, but will read more into. Given that the company has survived for quite some time, and still has a fairly healthy balance sheet, I think it’s a great short term and long term buy. There is while significant short term downside risk if OMS721 fails, I don’t think their totally nuked like some of the other biotechs are. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other really impressive thing is beyond their mix of diseases and targets, is that they’ve proven themselves to be competent in both the antibody space (OMS721), and the small molecule space (PDE7, PDE10, pparg) - plus their approved therapy (Omidria) Also they can run clinical trials. Also they’re developing platforms. Seriously, WTF? Its rare to see even larger companies this aggressive with different spaces. This all speaks volumes about leadership competency. They apparently are hiring a ton, because there are a bunch of job listings (75 ish) on linkedin  - which means the management has to be pretty bullish. On the flipside, glassdoor isn’t too kind to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm buying  NOV16 26C, OCT19 30C, and Stonk.  

&amp;#x200B;

0,1587,Let's learn about currency risk ($IQ $BABA etc bagholders gather round),"Before we get started, I'm well aware that not all (or even necessarily most) of the losses seen in Chinese stocks over the last week are because of currency risk. That's not the point. The point here is that for the amount of ""discussion"" of Chinese stocks we see here ($IQ, $BABA, $JD just to name a few), there is essentially zero discussion of currency risk - one of the most significant risks of investing in a foreign stock.  
  
Now, don't reply with some faggy-ass comment about how the stock price is in US Dollars and therefore currency exchange rates don't matter - that's not how any of these works, and you'd be dead wrong.  
  

  
The components of currency exchange risk are often broken down into three categories:  
  
1) Translation exposure - We'll come back to and talk more about this one, it's important and not as intuitive the next one.  
  
2) Transaction exposure - actually exchanging money from one currency to another. You'd want a strong dollar when buying foreign currency (because $1 buys more foreigner money), and a weak dollar when buying US dollars with foreign currency (because $1 costs you less foreigner money). If you only use RH you don't need to worry much about this because you can only buy things in USD anyway. Big boys with better brokerages beware - you can have a stock that has a positive return in percentage, but a negative return after converting from it's currency to USD - but you likely already know that.  
  
3) Economic exposure - exposure to the economic conditions in a foreign country. We won't really talk about this because I'm not an economist, and if you can't understand that some countries have different economic conditions than others, explaining that wouldn't be worth my time.  
  
Now, if you have $IQ, $BABA, $JD, or [Insert favorite chinese meme stock here], you're probably thinking this is mostly irrelevant. Of course you're exposed to the economy of China, and I'm an idiot for thinking you didn't know that. You would be wrong, it's ""Translation exposure"" I think you fags don't know about.  
  
If any of you have done actual DD on any of these companies, you'll notice that their [financial statements show currency values in CNY rather than USD](https://imgur.com/a/jorgBxK). As the value of CNY changes relative to USD, the value of these assets to you (and income from the income statement) also changes.  
  
You may wonder why this is being posted right now. Since April 20th (a recent low point), the US dollar is [up around 4%](https://www.wsj.com/articles/yuans-2018-gain-disappears-as-dollar-rallies-1529892432) versus the Chinese Yuan. CNY is worth less versus the dollar, and therefore Chinese companies have a lower value in USD, even if nothing else changed.  
  
This is inevitable if the exchange rate changes, because they aren't going to keep USD instead of CNY as cash (wouldn't be efficient for them). Even though ADR's are denominated in US Dollars, the assets and cash flows they represent are denominated in foreign currency, so you can't just ignore exchange rates.  
  
You could hedge against this using forex futures to some extent, but if you didn't know about this before now, you probably don't have a large enough investment to do so.

**The Approval**
-

[In my first thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/88wm6p/yolo_options_play_1000_or_0_long_dd_inside_for/) about PTLA, I wrote out DD for some long-shot scenarios in which you could potentially profit 1000% if PTLA went up to $60/share. This relied on PTLA getting not only approval for their blockbuster drug AndexXa, but a very solid approval with not too much uncertainty surrounding it. 

AndexXa today comes with, what seems like, a harsh Black Box Warning. I did predict it would come with a Black Box Warning, which I think was an obvious prediction, so I highly doubt it will catch investors off-guard. Basically, keep in mind that if *I'm* predicting something here, and it comes true, then investors around the world had already arrived at the same conclusions long ago. I had another ""doomsday"" prediction, in a sense, about the strongest possible limitations that could be placed upon AndexXa. This prediction **did not** come true. I'm just going to copy-paste what I wrote in my thread: 

&gt;I believe AndexXa will come with a Black Box Warning, with heavy limitations on its usage, but I also believe that it won't matter because there is no real alternative -- I predict that it may only be approved for treating Intracranial Hemorrhages. However, hospitals will use AndexXa regardless of the warnings, seeing as the only other option is death.

...

&gt;When and if AndexXa is approved, which I think will come with a harsh Black Box Warning, I believe PTLA will open at around $45/share. This will be much lower than expected had AndexXa instead come with a clean approval. But as positive sentiment rolls in, I believe that PTLA's price will rise from its opening price to at least $60/share as investors realize that Black Box Warnings don't matter for drugs like AndexXa. Institutional investors aren't stupid and I'm not a genius, so there might not be any negative sentiment and the price could just open up at $60+ in the first place. I'm not playing 4D chess here.

Before another one of you slick cats come in and tell me that it's wrong to say AndexXa 'treats' ICH, yes, I know. What AndexXa does is more complicated than simply 'treating' something, but I'm not getting into semantics on WSB of all places. 

-

AndexXa's approval comes with another little caveat, found in the press release: *""The post-marketing requirement is a clinical trial that randomizes patients to receive either Andexxa or usual care (the type of care the enrolling institution would provide in the absence of Andexxa). This study is scheduled to be initiated in 2019 and be reported in 2023.""*

**What You Need To Know**
-

I'm going to address the Phase IV trial bit first because I find it the most interesting, and there's something in there I didn't predict at all. I'm not sure how investors will react to this, but before I get into that portion, I believe this caveat hides something positive. In fact, I believe that this Phase IV requirement is perhaps the lightest it could have been. I did think the FDA would force PTLA to run another test following approval, which is not a very rare ask for drugs like these. A post-approval study (aka a Phase IV trial) can be either the FDA simply going through procedure and making sure all of their bases are covered, or it could be very serious. 

I was worried, as a worst-case scenario post-approval, that the FDA would force PTLA to complete and submit a highly accelerated Phase IV study by end of 2019. This would then go through an even more accelerated approval phase, after which the FDA would decide whether or not to pull AndexXa from the markets by 2Q 2020. 

This would *highly* limit PTLA's revenue outlook and make it risky for long-term investment. The year 2020 seems like it's far away, but less than 2 years of revenue from your blockbuster drug can crater investor sentiment. In this scenario, I thought that perhaps PTLA would only open at a price of $45/share. However, the FDA threw some little nuggets of information in there that I think will help PTLA's. 

-

First of all, PTLA needs to report their Phase IV results in 2023. I'm not quite sure why the FDA has such a lax deadline for PTLA, but regardless, this is great news. This means we get over 4 years of revenue coming in from AndexXa, which is long enough to surmise AndexXa's efficacy with or without the FDA's input on a completed Phase IV. So the risk here is dampened, I dare say, almost entirely. In fact, there's really no point in the FDA even requiring a Phase IV study from PTLA if the completion date itself is so far down the road. I don't get it. 

For a drug like this, with such a high risk for adverse effects, the FDA *should* want a study enrolled and done within 2 years tops (assuming, of course, that the drug is used widely enough for the required patient count). A deadline of what is effectively 5 years means nothing because, after 5 years of public data from broad use around the world, you don't really need the study anymore to decide whether a drug should stay or not. The FDA can pull a drug without forcing the issue prior in writing. Sure, a study is always better and more comprehensive, but it doesn't really serve the purpose I believe the FDA would want out of a pivotal Phase IV study. 

So I think what we have here is a Phase IV study without any real teeth, considering the drug at hand. My conclusion would have been different for, let's say, a drug that didn't involve life-or-death situations. 

-

Second, the Black Box Warnings does not, as I thought it might, come with a restriction on type of use. It only restricts based on what drug the patient in need used beforehand. This is what it says in the news release: *""Andexxa [coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated-zhzo] is indicated for patients treated with rivaroxaban and apixaban, when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding.""*

In effect, the FDA is restricting AndexXa in the lightest way possible. AndexXa was only studied in reversing Xarelto and Eliquis in the first place, so it would have been weird to see the FDA approve AndexXa for anything in response to beyond those two drugs. I thought the FDA would restrict AndexXa also on what conditions it was used to treat in their studies. Because the studies were bare-bones, this could have highly depressed share price at open. This didn't happen though, and we have a label that is pretty generous. 

The Black Box Warning does come with scary shit like **SUDDEN DEATHS**, but that doesn't mean anything to anyone serious about studying this stuff. The death rate for patients without AndexXa is stupidly high. Any doctor will risk ""sudden death"" in exchange for not-sudden death on the hospital bed. AndexXa overall has a much higher survival rate, so I don't believe this will be a problem. 

-

---

---

-

**What It Means For Market Open**
-

I think the market will open at $60/share tomorrow. AndexXa was not only approved, but given some pretty light sentencing, so to speak. The Phase IV study has no teeth, the Black Box Warning is light (all things considered), and the indication is stellar.

Now that you're down here, I'd like to gloat because fuck you all I deserve this shit.

When I wrote my very first article on Seeking Alpha in 2016, where I predicted that PTLA would not receive FDA approval for AndexXa due to their lackluster study, I received endless hate mail calling into question my expertise. People said I was just writing a hit piece because I had to disclose I was heavily short on PTLA at the time.

When PTLA got served a CRL for AndexXa, I wrote another article, in August of 2016 before any information had materialized, and laid out a timeline as to when PTLA would be ready to begin their new study and when they would file again with the FDA for another shot at approval. I also predicted that PTLA would gain FDA approval this next time. Both of those dates ended up being right on the mark, and today PTLA successfully received an approval for AndexXa on their second try.

0,1647,How to play extremely high-risk FDs with 1000% upside. With $JNJ and $AAPL as examples.,"Since [my last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8azo6j/if_you_bought_into_my_options_plays_thread/), I've been getting a lot of messages from people wanting more trade ideas. I promised another thread last week but ended up forgetting. I had a lot of fun writing this up last night while drinking beer and watching the Harry Potter movies. This took two entire Harry Potter movies to write. Prisoner of Azkaban is the best one.

Since you all love throwing your money away, I'll share how I play FDs. I cannot understate the risk involved here. I try to minimize risk by proactively closing out of an FD early if, for example, volume action in the morning is low (whether or not it opens green). I take into account many other things, which I won't go over in this thread, but just remember that nothing in this thread is even remotely close to being safe. If you're serious about following my advice here, please read the entire thread.

I only pursue FDs if there exists a realistic and reasonable scenario in which hitting a 1000% profit is not simply grasping at straws. I'll elaborate on this later. The title is not clickbait. It's possible to hit a 1000% banger over the course of a week with this strategy so long as you can stomach the losses you *will* come across. *A lot* of things need to happen for me to take the risk and open a play like this, and even more things need to go right -- with the correct timing -- to turn a profit. To show you what I mean, I'll share two example plays for this coming week. Do note that **the timing for these plays may have already passed**. Depending on what happens come Monday morning, if the following tickers open green and don't go back down enough for call prices to depress, it may be too late to get in on the 1000% action. 

In my opinion, these plays are simply not worth it if there isn't a realistic potential for 1000% gains because you will undoubtedly lose money on most of them. So you need big hits to justify the losses. If you're only looking at a 500% gain come Monday morning, assuming these tickers open green, proceed at your own peril. I personally don't mess with FDs if I'm only looking at a realistic upside of 500%.

**Johnson and Johnson ($JNJ)**
-

I haven't bought into this play yet because I was at work and forgot. I learned the hard way with PTLA that sharing plays early with you lot, before I've bought into them, can bite me in the ass. After I shared my play, call prices for PTLA went up and never dropped back down again afterwards, even though the share price went down... Regardless, JNJ will serve as a good example, and if Monday is red, there may be an opportunity to buy in. 

So, why a long-term company like JNJ specifically? This past week has been rough on JNJ. The company announced average earnings, which the market really didn't like because I honestly have no idea. There were some other tidbits of news surrounding JNJ recently, but I personally thought JNJ's results were fine. Not great, but still fine. Even before this report, JNJ got beat up a lot and share price had stagnated to where it was at almost a full year ago. I didn't have a stake in it, but I thought JNJ would go up with not-bad news. Not down. JNJ is near its 52-week low and is still a great company, with a great dividend, in a great market.

Thus sets the scene for a high-risk, 1000% banger. Great.

-

**READ THE FOLLOWING POINTS CAREFULLY.** They outline the kind of thought process I go through to justify playing FDs. There are different justifications for different companies and scenarios. Hopefully, with enough examples, you'll begin to see things through my gambling-tinted glasses. These points are listed in order of decreasing importance. 

1. JNJ earnings have passed, so options no longer carry high IV. 

2. JNJ is a historically safe growth company (for a biotech), and options are priced to reflect this usual stability. This is basically the Disney of pharmaceuticals, and like Disney, JNJ is very safe. We're banking on some unexpected volatility. 

3. Other major companies are announcing earnings next week, which, if positive, could lead to a huge reversal in the market. Google reports Monday. This is a double-edged sword because if Google shits the bed Monday, it's all over. 

4. There is no JNJ-specific news coming next week, other than a dividend increase announcement. This also greatly reduces IV. 

5. This is where the reasoning becomes less compelling, yet relevant enough to mention. JNJ's average dividend yield is ~2.75% over the past 5 years. JNJ is going to announce a dividend increase this coming week. I'm predicting an increase to 90 cents per quarter because that's more aesthetic than the expected 88 cents per quarter. I do actually believe, unironically, that JNJ will choose 90 cents over 88 cents because it's a better looking number (also tax cuts), so take that for what you will. Anyway, at 90 cents per quarter, JNJ's yield comes out to 2.84% from Friday's close, which is high for a reliable company that grows consistently and is sought after for its dividends. If we go by 90 cents at an average yield of 2.75%, we arrive at a fair share value of ~$131.

6. Open interest in puts and calls is pretty flat, all things considered. Nothing stands out, so that means big players aren't really in on this one way or the other. Sometimes this can be a factor, and sometimes not.

-

And now onto the actual play.

* **JNJ April 27th 131.00 calls**

These are worth 12 cents per contract, going by Friday's closing bid-ask spread. If JNJ goes up to $131 before Wednesday noon, an increase of 3.43%, these calls will **profit ~1000%**. 

If this move happens very early in the day Monday or Tuesday, the profit will be higher. And when I say ""Wednesday noon"", I don't actually mean right at Wednesday noon. What I really mean is early enough during the day on Wednesday so that the options are priced for a larger potential increase. If the target price of $131 is hit Wednesday at closing or Thursday open, these calls will profit less. 

These estimates are going to be off because we're dealing with moves that are far-fetched. Greeks will only get you so far when you're trying to predict moves on stuff like this because even the smallest of things -- like what *time* of day share price moves, with what kind of volume, on what kind of news, how volatile the market expects to be, etc, etc -- can affect option pricing and thus the final estimates. But, in general, I'm not wrong often.

By the way, if share price gaps down the next day, you're down at least 50%. Even a decrease of 0.5% in underlying share price at open is a death wish.

-

---

---

-

**Apple ($AAPL)**
-

I personally dislike Apple and its products, but the potential for a 1000% banger was too compelling, so I bought $3000 worth of FDs near Friday closing. I'll get right into the play and reasoning because you probably already know why Apple went down this past week. 

* **AAPL April 27th 172.50 calls**

These calls are worth roughly 55 cents each (I got them at 57 cents). If share price goes up to $172 or so, which is a bit less than where it was at Thursday closing, these calls will **profit ~500%**. If share price goes back up to around $178, which is around where it was at Wednesday closing, these calls will be deeply ITM and **profit ~1000%** regardless of what day of the week it is. Earlier in the week is still better and will yield a greater profit. The 500% profit scenario relies on a move early on in the week. 

Reasoning in decreasing significance: 

1. Apple's earnings report is not this coming week, but the following week on May 1st. This means these calls do not carry high IV. They still have some pretty high IV, but not earnings report kind of high IV. 

2. Other tech giants are reporting next week, with Google reporting *Monday*. This is absolutely huge, and the timing makes this play enticing as hell. A big run-up Tuesday morning following good news with Google means that these calls could go back to the 170-180 level. We have a chance to effectively play an Apple earnings report without buying into the IV of an actual earnings report. When Google shoots up during an earnings report, so too does Apple (usually... kind of...). This isn't only because they're both tech companies, but it plays a big role. This is a heavier connection than the JNJ-Google one mentioned above. 

3. Merrill Lynch is literal trash. 

4. Again, this is much less compelling, but still relevant enough to put in here. There isn't a lot of open interest for calls at this expiration date. Open interest is relatively low for every price until you get to $175 strike. There is however a lot of open interest for puts ranging from OTM puts to ITM puts up to $175 strike. So I believe that big money sold a ton of puts, but not a lot of calls, because they expect a move up to a little less than $175/share. Big money players may try to pin share price at around $175 so calls at this strike price don't go ITM. They then get to rake in them premiums from both ends of the stick. 

5. With the tax cuts and Apple's big win regarding cash repatriation, I expect Tim Cook to swoop in and save the day next week with huge buybacks. We already know Apple and other companies (assuming they're good at timing buybacks) love to buy back shares when sentiment is low and share price has taken a slump. I think that these buybacks will spark a big rally when coupled with good earnings.

-

As always, risk is very high and you know the drill by now. A bad report by Google means there's a good chance both of these plays fall flat. If everything doesn't go exactly as planned, these plays will fall flat. Keep that in mind before you think about following along the 1000% road.

0,1650,Summary Of $TSLA's situation,"Summary of Tesla's situation:
- Tesla currently has 2.67 billion in cash.

- About 1.1 billion of this is in loans that need to be returned early next year

- Around 40% of their cash in hand is from refundable deposits, from people who thought they would get a $35k car

- Tesla cannot make $35k M3s at a profit(this is widely accepted, and even Tesla hinted at it), they'll lose money even making $42k cars. They need to make $50k cars to earn a decent profit

- When asked in the earning call last week about reservations and how many people chose to cancel/take up their car once offered, Musk stunningly called the question ""boring"" and ""boneheaded"" and went on take questions from a youtuber for 20 mins. This was considered unprecedented and bizarre and stock dove.

- Tesla is losing about 800-900 million a quarter, so they will run out of money without a cash infusion. Literally everyone knows that Tesla will need to raise capital this year.

- Musk though, has insisted that Tesla will not need to raise cash because they will be ""profitable by Q3 or Q4"". Reminder that they lost 780 million in Q1, and even small profits won't be enough to prevent running out of cash. In order to make profits they need to sell 10,000 cars a week. They were supposed to produce 5000 cars a week in 2017. They have just now been able to produce 2500/week.

- Even bulls say that Musk is bluffing and he will eventually raise cash this year. Moody's downgrade of Tesla to essentially junk stocks makes it harder to raise cash at good interest rates. Moreover, there is speculation and some evidence that the reason Tesla haven't already done so, is that they are under SEC investigation which would prevent them from raising cash without disclosing a lot of details harmful to them.

- Tesla has access to standard credit lines for about 500 million, but they recently had to pledge their Fremont factory to just maintain these credit lines.

- A lot of Tesla's financial executives have left the company - a red flag to many including Jim Chanos, who famously shorted Enron due to similar indicators. The head of autopilot left and the head of engineering left 'for vacation' last week.

- Tesla's autopilot is complete false advertising. Their original autopilot was developed by MobilEye. MobilEye hated tesla's exaggeration of the system's capabilities and withdrew their supply after a person died using autopilot. Tesla responded that mobileye was jealous of Tesla's superior ""Enhanced Autopilot"" which has hardware capable of full self driving. It is universally accepted that enhanced autopilot is worse than mobileye's system right now, and in general both are basically lane-keeping system with AEB. Waymo and GM/Cruise are far ahead with their FSD capabilities than Tesla(again, widely accepted)

- Part of Tesla's debt comes from bailing out Solar City, a completely unprofitable company loaded with debt that was run by Musk's cousins.

- Starting from 2019 and 2020, all the major automakers are bringing out electric models. This will further damage Tesla's competitiveness, since they have the wost QA and build quality due to their haphazard and panicked development process

Despite all this, the market cap of tesla is larger than Ford, Fiat and nearly equal to GM. Their inflated market cap(which even Musk admits is inflated) is fuelling their funding which inflates the market cap even more as they lose more money trying to make bigger promises. A classic example of a huge bubble.

What does Tesla have to it's advantage? Tremendous marketing and brand value. They're probably inching towards or even surpassing Apple

What does Tesla have against it? The realities of running a business and actually making the products.

**DISCLAIMER**  

Since I can't seem to figure out how to plot the lines 26 days ahead, as everything past the white line you see on the graph is meant to be trends/momentum 26 days in the future--Visualize the lines as going ahead of the current day's price.  

**DD**  

For those of you who do not know analysis using Ichimoku Clouds go [here.](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:ichimoku_cloud)  

**$SPX:** Prices are converging on the cloud so expect the onset of a bearish trend. Expect some near term resistance to upward movement for the S&amp;P (especially when the cloud turns red in ~14 days). Watch for a death cross (Tenken blue line crosses Senkou(52) red line) and prices moving below the red line. That will signal that momentum has shifted and you better scramble to get puts. MACD converging but difference is still well above 1. RSI is still in an ok spot.  

**$AMD**: RSI is very high, signalling being overbought. MACD difference below 1 signalling not-so-strong of a bullish trend compared to when you just analyze the conversion (tenken) and base line (senkou B(52)). Prices are above the cloud which indicates a bullish trend but expect resistance to further rises in the near term. Conversely, if it falls there will be no resistance to buoy it up.  

**TL;DR**: Japanese man in '60s looks at shape of clouds for market DD. Buy puts if reversals in trend happen as there will be future resistance (barring news catalysts). Otherwise, be cautious on calls in the next month, look for large dips instead of buying at the high.

[Ref. forecast for 5/7/18 - 5/11/18](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8h9ve8/us_economic_results_5718_51118/)

Let's go over the results for yesterday:

**FORECAST**

**Core CPI (MoM) (Apr)**

Predicted: 0.2

Actual: 0.1

Core CPI measures the price of a ""basket"" of consumer goods, excluding food and energy, and is generally viewed as a good indicator of inflation trends. 

For those WSBers whose retardation levels are especially high, one of the drivers in this year's multiple Great Recessions was the market's concern with inflation running amok. This fear appears to have been assuaged over the last few weeks, with lower-than-expected increases in wage growth, bond yields staying at comfortable levels (after the market finished freaking out about those, anyway), etc.

In a nutshell, market got scurred of its shadow, shit happened, and now it can move on to checking if the next burner on the stove is hot (where anything above lukewarm is worth panicking over).

**WHAT TO EXPECT**

Predicted: Boring

Results: Green

My record, so far: 10/19 (52.63% -- down from 55.56%)

I almost had this one! $SPY opened at $270.35, went up to $272-something, then dropped back to within the $270.35-$271.35 range -- right before it went back up above $272. 

**ANY REVISIONS?**

Can't revise -- missed the deadline again. This week has been a fucking bitch-and-a-half.

**ANYTHING ELSE?**

From what I can tell, the market is back on track to greenville, with the only remaining obstacles being flattening yield curves (very unlikely to happen, short-term), Trump's shenanigans, and China -- all of which the market seems to be getting used to.

Oil concerns me, though. In my area, gas is already $0.20/gallon higher, since Trump's announcement on Tuesday, and higher oil prices eat into consumer spending in more ways than at the pump: it translates to higher food costs, higher manufacturing costs, etc. Plus, if oil drops below $70/bbl again, the momentum its upward rise imparted on the markets will be lost. It really seems like a no-win situation, where the only question is whether it will be a slow drain or a torrent of red (sounds hyperbolic, but these posts are great for practicing creative writing).

Given the transfer of shares from yesterdays highs to premarket, there was a strong indication large investors had sold their positions, therefore there was NOT going to be big money holding this thing up, especially when its up over 50% from yesterdays close.

I shorted at $19.09, and covered 3 hours into the day at $15.20, for +20,171.

I live streamed this trade to our chatroom and called my position as soon as I placed it. Also posted my P/L and a screenshot of my profits for all to see. Check it out on my Twitter and follow my journey to $1M in profits this year. Twitter.com/MajTrader09

2. Harley Davidson was founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1903. Ever since then, they've been annoying anyone within 2500 ft of roadways with their obnoxious noises. They've ruined lives, with their riders accounting for about [2 percent of vehicles on the road but 10 percent of all traffic fatalities](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/10/a-new-risk-of-middle-age-dying-on-a-motorcycle/). It's getting so ridiculous that even [people named after their company are racist](https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2018/01/harley_barber_apologizes_for_r.html) (shoutout Papa John!!).  Harley bikes have also caused deaths such as [this nice old lady](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-44903969) in recent months.

3. Everyone knows how annoying and dangerous their products are, so let's get into the financials. Long story short, they suck. Growth has been declining, at around 5% for the past 5 years. Sales revenue is expected to decline by more than 10%!  Financials and numbers don't actually matter, and I've spent far too long writing this than I should have, so I'm going to wrap it up. 

4. Tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum don't help either. Harley's costs of doing business have increased, and they've been forced to [shut down factories in the USA and move them to Thailand.] (https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/business/2018/05/09/union-rips-harley-davidson-closing-kansas-city-plant/595901002/) This is on top of the already decreasing revenues pre-tariffs.

5. The last, ever more important factor is they decided to complain to Trump about tariffs.  Over the past year, this [is apparently good for companies](https://people.com/politics/donald-trump-twitter-feuds-companies/), judging by that list. But it won't be for Harley, because they build factories in Thailand to support Thailand things (you know what I mean). That is all.

0,1791,Look for the bearish equities. The simple bearish faggy d's. Here's a list for all your worries and your strife.,"In the spirit of October here's a list of spooky things I was thinking about while considering what I want to do on Monday.

\- Underfunded pension plans are a problem. Don't know much about it though.

\- Massive US fiscal deficit. Probably from helping all those Puerto Rican's

\- Limited reserves from years of low interest rates (lots of fun implications here).

\- 2020 IMO [Sulfer Cap](http://www.seatrade-maritime.com/images/PDFs/SOMWME-whitepaper_Sulphur-p2.pdf). ""catastropic economic implications""

\- Saudi Arabia [catching bodies](https://gph.is/2f4AWbm).

\- South China Sea conflict.

\- Student loans (great way to fund some your gambling addiction).

\- Social Security predicted to be insolvent by 2034.

\- Medicare predicted to be insolvent by 2026.

\- China is losing the trade war.

\- USA is losing the trade war.

\- Sneaky ass Russia's up to something. Trump was starting shit with them yesterday too over guns or something.

\- Global supply chain is shifting drastically. If you're thinking it's everyone shifting to accommodate the US and avoid China then you'd be correct because we run shit (Fuck Yeah). Lets check to be sure though...Looks like Venezuala is kind of pissed that we dumpstered their economy and is going to be working with China [now](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-13/china-to-give-venezuela-5-billion-loan-as-maduro-visits-beijing). That'll be fine though we're tight with Cuba again and that was a pretty similar situation. Plus it's just money it's not like China  [has any bad intentions.](http://time.com/5381467/china-africa-debt-us-security/) They just want them to get back on their feet. Seems like there's some speculation that Canada might try to work around the USMCA (NAFTA2) deal to establish trading w/ China. Doesn't look like anything to me though \*turns CNBC volume up\*.

\- Venezuela's core inflation rate right now is 488,865.00%.

\- Emerging markets spanked around recently too (

\- [Automotive lending](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/388636-trump-signs-repeal-of-auto-loan-policy-targeting-racial-bias)  rn makes my brain hurt.  Seriously, take a look at this. Trump issued an executive order in response to **GUIDANCE** \*this is not normal\* from the CFPB with blatantly racist implications) Not to mention the lending restrictions are basically non-existent here, 3rd party company's can create their own financing terms without the standard transparency/oversight required of traditional lending institutions.

\- Speaking of oversight I don't think anyone's keep PE in check. Lots of money, over-levered, under-scrutinized. If you've ever met a human being or heard of an CDO this can get a nice cold sweat going.

\- Don't forget about variable rate mortgages which get more expensive as interest rates go up! Oh yeah, interest rates are going up by the way which is bad for equities in general. ripsears

\- R.I.P. Sears (Shout out to the [GOAT](https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-predicted-fall-of-eddie-lampert-sears-in-2005-2016-12) though. PS between us he dropped a couple billion on a real estate deal that's worth lookin into a few months before SEARs went under).

\- Then there's the lending firms that offer predatory refinancing deals to veterans and other groups typically taken advantage of, so they can switch that pesky fixed rate mortgage into a much longer term variable rate mortgage. Some are paying triple digit interest rates at the moment. You can learn more by googling ""scum of the earth"". No huge market implication here, but fuck these assholes.

\- The housing market is faltering. (don't forget college graduates 30 years ago were actually able to afford houses working the same jobs that don't even cover rent in most places nowadays).

\- Jobs data less optimistic across the board last time I checked (U-6&gt;Unemployment rate). There's also a lot more part time workers now so that employees don't have to worry about those boring things like healthcare, retirement funds and pensions!

\- Increase in corporate buybacks could be artificially inflating prices.

\- China has banned all new video games.

\- The spookiest of all is the fact that history tends to repeat itself. There are striking similarities, and some major differences between right now and periods around market crashes. At the end of the day though war breaking out is an all too realistic possibility, and that is what we are all scared of most. China does aggressively go after intellectual property, and had been flooding US markets with cheap illegal raw materials. We've also been in an official cyber war with China for a lot longer than it's been in the news. Historically, the #1 cause of major wars is when the leading economic power is threatened by another rising economic power. Just saying...China's on the come up.

&amp;#x200B;

**BONUS ROUND**: Levered up HFT sentiment analysis algo's! I wonder what a crash where mass hysteria gets front run by algos looks like.

&amp;#x200B;

*Honorable Mention:* 

\- Global Warming -- Natural disasters have quadrupled since the 1970's,  and every one of the past 40 years has been warmer than the 20th century average. 2016 was the hottest year on record. The 12 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1998. 

\- Kanye West

*In summary:*

I'm writing all of this because I want to start a **serious** conversation here about the stock $AMD.  Given all this info is the best strategy buying $50 10/26 calls tomorrow or should I play it safe with $50 10/26 calls on Tuesday when everything is back to normal and volatility is a bit lower?

Option 1- They do a major overhaul of their business model and management. The current CEO doesn't seem to know how to make money and has been messing up the platform and driving away users (aka their only value) for years now 

Option 2- They go private somehow with hopes of restructuring and moving into developing overseas markets but this will take years to make good penetration this could however help boost there users and ad revenue in the long run.

Option 3- (this option is purely hypothetical and I really don't see it happening) They get bought out by someone. The reason this seems unlikely is that they really don't have much to offer in the way of revenue generation and whoever buys will have to be willing to get into the social media business which is kinda cornered by $FB and Instagram. Instagram has also been taking away users at a steady rate which is cutting into snaps dismal revenue making a buy even less likely

**Notables**

* Their EPS estimates this year are a little more aggressive than year's past, so they've got some lofty goals. But if met, they should continue to rise. 
* Hit 52 week high of $50.73 on 7/26. Currently about 6% off.

0,1867,"$IMDZ - Immune Design, done for now Im drunk","#**IMDZ – Immune Design Corp**


#**Overview:**

Immune Design is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on developing treatments to enable the body’s own immune system to fight diseases.  Their focus lies on the oncology sector, having engineered technologies to activate the immune system’s natural ability to create tumor-specific cytotoxic T Cells to fight cancer.  Their belief is that their two main drug candidates will address what other therapies are currently lacking while having the potential to treat a broad patient population through either individual therapies or in conjunction with other mechanisms of action.  Although their main focus is the immuno-oncology, they believe that their candidates also have potential to serve in therapeutic realms such as infectious and allergic diseases as they have a few different collaboration and partnerships underway leveraging their GLAAS platforms.  

Immune Design’s management team, board of directors, and scientific advisory board boast a diverse group of individuals who don’t lack experience in the industry.  The CEO, Carlos Paya, has served as Vice President at Eli Lilly, President of Elan Corporation, and was also a professor of Medicine, Immunology, and Pathology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.  The company also has an extensive list of Doctors and PhD researchers backing the company’s advisory board and management team.
  

#**Pipeline:**

The company currently has 6 different products in their pipeline ranging from Preclinical to Phase II.  Still in the early stages of development, the company is actively seeking growth and partnerships to solidify their financial and developmental future.  Each of their GLAAS products, 3 of them, have partnerships lined up for the development and licensing of the candidates.  These partnerships include Sanofi, MedImmune, and Sanofi Pasteur.   To match their product collaborations, they are also working in conjunction with Merck and Genetech in clinical collaborations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of their immuno-oncology products. 
Their immuno-oncology pipeline also has 3 candidates targeting different forms of cancer.  Their entire pipeline is as follows:

 

#**Specific Drug:**

While the company has several different products filling their pipeline, we are concerned with CMB305.  Immune Design has entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Genetech, a member of Roche, to better evaluate the safety and efficacy of CMB305 cancer immunotherapy when combined with the investigational cancer immunotherapy atezolizumab in patients with soft tissue sarcoma.  

CMB305 is a prime-boost product designed to target tumors that express the NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen, specifically soft tissue sarcoma.  NY-ES0-1 is expressed in a large number of solid and liquid state tumors in varying degrees.  CMB305 is comprised of two parts, a “prime” and a “boost”, which are designed to work synergistically to induce anti-tumor cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response targeting the NY-ES0-1-expressing tumors.  It is also hypothesized that CMB305 will also generate memory CTLs, providing for long-term immune response systems while enhancing other immune anti-tumor mechanisms along the way.  

Currently, CMB305 is in different stages of clinical development, which include monotherapy Phase I as well as a fully-enrolled Phase II trial comprised of individuals with two subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma (synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma).  This combination study is utilizing either CMB305 with Genetech’s cancer immunotherapy TECENTRIQ, or atezolizumab alone. 

Last year, the company reported positive clinical and biomarker data for CMB305 as a monotherapy.  In 25 soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients with recurrent disease treated with CMB305, median overall survival (mOS) had still not yet been reached, with an overall survival rate at 12 and 18 months of 83% and 76%, respectively. These data compare favorably to mOS for approved second line and later sarcoma agents, which is only 12.4-13.5 months, as well as a published mOS of 11.7 months for synovial sarcoma patients specifically; the largest patient population enrolled in this trial. A disease control rate of 64% was observed, including durable tumor growth arrest in patients who had evidence of disease progression at study entry. Also, CMB305 was well tolerated, and generated a strong and broad anti-NY-ESO-1 immune response in &gt;50% of the patients, including evidence of antigen spreading – the induction of an immune response against other tumor antigens not targeted by CMB305. In addition, the presented data showing a statistically-significant association of an induced response and clinical benefit in a pooled set of patients treated with CMB305 or LV305. The immune biomarkers studied, including novel bio-markers derived from public TCRS may guide regulatory strategy via the selection of patients more likely to have survival benefit on CMB305 therapy benchmarks. 

Immune Design has received Orphan Drug Designation in soft tissue sarcoma for both components of CMB305 in the EU and US, and depending upon further trial results soft tissue sarcoma will be the first indication in which CMB305 will be filed for regulatory approval.  There is a significant unmet need in this market, and the company holds the stance that the potential benefit of CMB305 to patients will be higher safety for patients and improved survival rates. 


#**Current and Forecasted Market:**

Synovial sarcoma is a cancer in the joints with a five-year and ten-year survival for people with Grade 3 tumors or metastatic disease of less than 25% and 15%, respectively, and Myxoid round cell liposarcoma is a malignant tumor that most often occurs in the deep-seated soft tissues of the extremities. Currently marketed treatments have high toxicity, with up to 37% of patients experiencing Grade 3/4 Adverse Events. 
Soft tissue sarcoma is rapidly growing, expected to reach a global CAGR of over 8% over the next 6 years.  With over 50 different types of soft tissue sarcoma, it is a rare and diverse group of cancers that can develop from nearly any tissue.  There are approximately 13,000 individuals who suffer from soft tissue sarcoma each year, and with a high incidence rate and increased awareness about the condition, the market is expected to continue to expand.  
The current soft tissue sarcoma market size is valued around $700 million as of 2017, and with an expected CAGR of more than 8%, In 2017, 12,715 new diagnosis and 5,070 deaths due to STS were reported in the U.S. Bone sarcomas accounted for 3,373 new cases and 1,649 deaths in 2017. The lifetime risk of developing a sarcoma is 0.4%. Approximately 45.0% of bone sarcomas and 21.0% of STS are diagnosed in people in the age group of 0-35 years.  Currently, chemotherapy and targeted therapy are the only approved treatments for sarcoma.  Several immuno-oncology agents are also under investigation, with Immune Design leading the forefront to fill this unmet market need. 


#**Competition:**

The largest market competition are companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, and Celgene and others.  However, not all of these companies are focusing on developments in immuno-oncology and developing long term body resistance to tumors.   There is a large market for immuno-oncology that is unmet and waiting to be filled.  Novartis holds roughly 30% of the market share for sarcoma treatment, which Immune Design seeks to start to take if the product becomes approved.  


Financials:

MDZ reported loss of 29 cents per share in second-quarter 2018, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 30 cents and the year-ago loss of 54 cents.

Immune Design’s shares have lost 8.9% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 1.2%.  However their revenues are up this quarter YOY to $0.76 million mainly due to the collaboration with Sanofi for G103 and product sales to collaboration partners.  R&amp;D expenses are increasing as they are moving along their extensive pipeline through the clinical phases.   

Biggest note on their finances, Immune Design expects cash on hand to be enough to fund operations through the second half of 2020.  Due to their strategic partnerships and financing, the company is able to limit diluting investors or taking on greater debt.  The company has enough cash and cash equivalents, $73 million, to finance all operations for more than a year, which is a very rare occurrence in these small cap biotech companies. 


#**Review:**

My sort of concerns, the low rate of success that oncology drug candidates have with the FDA.  Cancer is a tough market.  Data shows that cancer drugs have the lowest success rate of making it from Phase I to FDA approval, a mere 3.4%.  Although, cancer trials that used biomarkers had higher success rates, though, and the overall oncology drug approval rate for 2015 was 8.3%, which was due to the booming immuno-oncology field.  So, although oncology drugs lag, immuno-oncology pulls does not.  The past few years, especially under the Trump administration, drug approval rates have been higher than ever in recent history.  

For this product, Phase II studies patients and provides researchers with additional safety data to refine research questions and develop further methodologies to study the candidate and efficacy.  They utilize this data to formulate Phase III protocols.  Will not really reveal any benefits of the drug or therapeutic effects, rather simply show the safety of the product with some minor data.

As stated earlier, the company believes that CMB305 to patients will be higher safety for patients and improved survival rates.  Along with Orphan Designation and the need to get effective drugs approved in the Oncology market, I believe the FDA will try to push a product such as this through. I have no fear of dilution due to the cash on hand to hold them for another two years. 

Looking at their chart, the stock price has held a $3.30 support zone for the past year, consistently bouncing off of these low levels producing 10% plus gains and even going as far up as $5.00 just a few months ago.  The volatility of this stock is fairly high, and I would personally use this to my advantage.  They diluted with a $80 million offering in October 2017 causing a massive drop in share price.  I doubt the company will seek to ruin their shareholder base further any time soon.  I feel a purchase at under $3.40 is a great move and holding for $4.00 minimum.  


#**TLDR**:

Shit looks like a solid buy at this cheap support level.  They are showing safety in their studies or hinting at it, Phase II is all about safety, and with the Orphan Drug designation they have potential to meet a dire need.  Plenty of cash on hand, already screwed their investors with a dilution a year ago, dont have to worry about a dilution for another year or so as they have cash on hand to operate for two years.  I can see a 20-30% increase in the next month or two going from $3.30 to $4.00 as my minimum price target.

0,1868,$PRTK - Paratek Pharma DD.,"#**PRTK – Paratek Pharmaceuticals**

#**Overview:**

Paratek Pharmaceuticals is a biotech company based out of Boston, who focuses on providing solutions enabling positive outcomes for patients…Which is literally every other biotech company.  A very generic mission statement, but that is besides the point because they want their story to be remembered, a good play to the social aspect that many companies are trying to be a part of in todays world.  Right now, this company is working on changing how bacterial infections are treated. With the most common treatment of bacterial infections being through intravenous methods, treatments are limited to hospitals and clinics where as they want to continue to develop a new class of antibiotics, aminomethylcyclines, which allows for different, more accessible venues for dosing.  

This company really wants to have a meaningful impact, which is a great sentiment to have.  To back their cause, they do have a successful pipeline so far and show promise.  Their staff and executive team display a long history of success with having worked on a combined 75 late stage developments (phase 3 and beyond), 47 NDA’s or MAA, and 51 product launches.

The CEO has worked with several different biotech industry at an executive or director role such as being a general partner at Abingworth LLP, and even currently serving on the board of directors at Adamas Pharmaceuticals and InMediata.  The COO and CFO both also have extensive history of success with major companies such as Pfizer, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, and Biogen.  All in all, the company has a successful group in the leadership roles where its not their first trip around the block.  They bring experience and knowledge to their positions. 

#**Pipeline:**

As previously mentioned, Paratek develops a class of antibiotics known as aminomethylcyclines, which have broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.  They have two products in their pipeline with several different potential indications.  Both products are derivatives of Tetracycline.  

**Omadacycline**

Omadacycline is a derivative of tetracycline in the form of aminomethycycline.  Over the past 70 years since the inception of tetracycline, an increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance to tetracyclines has made the products much less effective and limited in current use.  Formulated for both IV and oral dosing, Omadacycline is being developed for 5 different indications, with 3 awaiting approval in PDUFA.  

**Sarecycline**

Sarecycline is a Phase III candidate, oral tetracycline derivative being developed for the treatment of acne and rosacea in a community setting because of its narrow spectrum antibiotic characteristics in treating inflammation. The company has licensed all of the US rights to Allergan for the development and commercialization of the product, however retaining all rights outside of the States.  This large partnership shows confidence in the company from a powerhouse in the industry and will provide cashflow while reducing expenses. 

#**Specific Drug:**

We will be focusing on Sarecycline for this write up due to the upcoming PDUFA date which is expected to be mid October.  Paratek has partnered with Allergan to develop and commercialize SeysaraTM (Sarecycline) for the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris in individuals 9 years and older.  Designed to treat acne in a community setting, meaning that it is focused on treating bacteria which is causing acne in communal settings spread through interaction.  

Acne is the most common skin condition in the US, with an affected market of roughly 50 million individuals.  While there are many factors leading to the cause of acne, this company focuses on the bacteria, p. acnes, which lives on human skin and can often clog the pores.  Inside the pore, the bacteria multiply at an astounding rate due to the perfect environment for replication and cause the pore to become inflamed, causing acne to appear.  

Last December, the company and Allergan filed their NDA based on positive data from two Phase III studies, SC1401 and SC1402, which was accepted by the FDA.  The Phase III results met primary endpoints at all levels and revealed patients treated with Seysara demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in acne severity compared to placebo at 12 weeks.  

Both SC1401 &amp; SC1402 were designed to be replicative phase 3 randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 1.5 mg/kg per day of Sarecycline compared to placebo in the treatment of moderate to severe acne.

The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral Sarecycline 1.5 mg/kg per day compared to placebo in treating inflammatory acne lesions in subjects with moderate to severe acne based on Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) scale score and inflammatory lesion counts. Patients were randomized (1:1) into two treatment groups to receive either Sarecycline tablets (60 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg, providing a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day) or placebo once a day for 12 weeks.

Sarecycline was statistically significantly (p &lt; 0.004) superior to placebo with respect to primary efficacy endpoints. The most common adverse events (&gt;2%) reported in the Sarecycline group were nausea (3.2%), nasopharyngitis (2.8%), and headache (2.8%). The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events among Sarecycline-treated patients in the two studies combined was 1.4%.  The drug has proven itself to be super tolerable, minimal adverse effects, and statistically significant in working effectively. 

 

#**Current and Forecasted Market:**

The Global Cystic Acne Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10% during the forecast period 2017-2023. Mainly owing to increase in patient population. According to American Academy of Dermatology, in 2015, 60 million Americans have active acne and around 20 million have acne badly enough to cause scars.  Additionally, approximately 85% of people between the ages of 12 and 24 experience at least minor acne.  Rising prevalence of this condition in both developed and developing countries is driving the cystic acne market growth.  With Allergan’s license on the US market, this leaves the growing developing world market and European markets open for Paratek to control.  It is estimated by the American Academy of Dermatology Association that in 2016 alone, the costs associated with the treatment of acne exceeded $3 billion.  

Paratek’s focus on community bacteria treatment is ideal for developing countries such as the Asian Pacific, Middle East, and Africa.  While Europe has a huge market for acne treatment, the aforementioned markets are booming at a higher rate.  Countries such as India and China are the fastest growing due to the massive influx of population and high healthcare spending.  While Paratek is making money off of the US market through their license to Allergan, they will also be able to leverage the developed product and work on global commercialization to treat the rapid growing markets that will exceed the US market in short time.

#**Competition**:

There are a ton of tetracycline-based treatments for moderate to severe acne, however it is often revealed that the p. acne bacteria can be resistant to the treatments. The market for streatment of antibiotic-resistant p. acnes is a much smaller market.  A company, Foamix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. FOMX is developing FMX101 in late-stage studies for treating moderate to severe acne.  We shall see the results of their production and late stage study results in coming months.

#**Financials**:

Looking over their financial statements, they have recently strengthened their balance sheet by raising $159 million in proceeds from issuing convertible senior subordinated notes in April set to mature in 6 years.  They also amended the financial terms of the Hercules Loan Agreement they have, increasing the principal taken out by $10 million with the potential for an additional $20 million to be borrowed.  

They recently reported a net loss of $29.7 million, or -$0.94 per share, compared to last years $18.2 million for the same quarter, a YOY increased loss of roughly 50%.  Not good at all, however things are looking to turn around in coming months with pending approval of two drugs with several designations.  Costs were increasing due to the preparation for commercialization and additional headcount, increased marketing, and other commercial costs that the company is taking to prepare for approval and launch.  

The company states that they have cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities that value at a total of $321.1 million.  Their cash and cash equivalents make up $56 million of that value.  Not the best financial situation.

#**Review:**

My thoughts, MAYBE a short term buy.  It is currently trending down and could be bought for a swing trade up towards approval.  Between Sarecycline and also the coming potential approval of Omadacycline in early October, this stock can see a big swing up.  You can review the information on Omadacycline below, its well-articulated in their presentation and likely to be approved. 

http://paratekpharma.com/media/1598/corporate-september-2018.pdf

However, I have my doubts about the company.  They have diluted shares several times around events and it seems like a common trend for the company.  Antibiotics is a tough market to launch in and be successful in.  Thankfully with their partnership with Allergan, they can see success in that drug.  Allergan is a massive company with a massive sales force that will literally go to physicians and shove the product down their throats.  However, with Omadacycline, they have no such partnership.  Likely to see a weak launch, the company will probably burn a ton of cash fast trying to market the product Omadacycline, but will likely see income generated from the licensing of Sarecycline.  Will it offset, unlikely.  The company will likely take a hit trying to market off a weak launch, dilute investors even further to raise capital shortly after approval.  That, or the company will move to take on more debt, drawing that additional $20 million from their loan agreement.  

My plan of action, buy a position now at $9.30 and increase size of position if I see $8.75-8.50.  Sell immediately after news if positive with a price target of $11.  This will likely be a short-term play.  However, I would also consider waiting until approval to even make a move.  With their financial position and history of dilutions, I see the stock taking a hit following the results from the FDA throughout October.  The company’s plan and pipeline will see no short-term success.  Their plan is to lay the tracks down for future revenues and market share, with success coming in 3+ years.  I can see a smart play waiting until early November to enter a position, after both drugs have received notice from the FDA and following the stocks likely drop and holding a long-term, 3+ year position. 



#TLDR

Two options here.  Buy now and maybe average down if it drops under $9, then sell immediately on news.  Or, wait until after news comes out on the two drug candidates expected in October and then buy.  I would personally wait to buy following news and potential dilution.  The company has a history of diluting shares and I can see them doing it within a week or two of approval, if not same day.  I would look to buy for long term, 3+ years, early November as they are laying groundwork for future success and revenues.  ",2018-09-15 00:40:51,['PRTK']

Overview:

Selecta Biosciences is a clinical-stage biopharma company focused on oppressing the body’s immune response to make therapies more efficient.  They are combining their tolerogenic Synthetic Vaccine Particles (SVP) to multiple therapies for rare diseases.  They currently have 5 products in their pipeline which range from SVP-enabled enzymes and oncology, to gene therapies.  Based out of Watertown, MA, just outside Boston, the company hopes to treat patients that currently have ineffective or are completely lacking treatments.  

The company not only has a US base, but they also have a subsidiary in Moscow, Russia which is building a pipeline of targeted immunotherapies and vaccines in oncology and infectious diseases.  This is being developed off of their SVP candidates and their hope is to expand their portfolio of immunotherapies in conjunction with the research and development occurring in Boston.

The company has multiple collaborations going on currently because of their SVP product which interacts with the immune system and induces antigen-specific immune responses.  This broad application of the SVP products allows them to collaborate with other companies to test the compatibility of the SVP with their therapies.  

The collaborations that Selecta has are with 3SBio, Duke University Medical Center, Genethon, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, National Cancer Institute, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and 
the Skolkovo Foundation.  


**Pipeline:**

Representing a robust pipeline, this company currently has five different candidates ranging from Preclinical to Phase II while targeting several different therapeutic areas.  

SEL-212 – Chronic Severe Gout

SEL-403 – Pancreatic Cancer and Mesothelioma

SEL-302 – Methylmalonic Acidemia (MMA) – Gene Therapy

SEL-313 – Ornithine Transcarbamylase

Hemophilia A - Gene Therapy - provided Spark Therapeutics with exclusive worldwide rights.


While most of the products are in the Preclinical Phase, there is one in Phase II and another in Phase I.  Our main focus however is on SEL-212, Tophaceous Gout, which is expected to present Phase II five-monthly dose data at the ACR meeting with a pivotal trial to begin Q4 2018.  SEL-212 is a monthly treatment consisting of pegsiticase, a potent uric acid lowering uricase enzyme, administered alongside SVP-Rapamycin to prevent ADA (anti-drug antibodies) which might otherwise compromise the medications safety and efficacy.  


**Specific Drug:**

SEL-212 so far in clinical trials has demonstrated that it has the capability to significantly lower serum uric acid levels down to those conductive to rapid tophi dissolution and the reduction of flares and other symptoms.  

Currently being studied for the treatment of chronic severe gout, the drug candidate shows great promise.  Chronic severe gout presents itself as a high burden of inflammatory nodules of crystalized uric acid (tophi) that have no response to current medications.  This often leads to debilitating flares, gouty arthritis, and a low quality of life.  SEL-212 aids the drug being administer in conjunction by avoiding adverse reactions due to immunogenicity. 

Recently the company presented expanded data from patients receiving up to 0.15 mg/kg of SVP Rapamycin with 0.2/0.4 mg/kg of pegsiticase from its Phase 2 trial of SEL-212, designed to be the first non-immunogenic version of uricase.  The data reported that patients receiving three monthly doses of SEL-212 up to 0.15 mg/kg of SVP-Rapamycin in combination with 0.2/0.4 mg/kg of pegsiticase, followed by two monthly doses of pegsiticase alone.  Roughly 81% of evaluable patients (n=27) had serum uric acid control below 6 mg/dL at week 12, which indicates a great response in bringing patients down to normal uric acid levels which range up to 6.0 mg/dL for females and 7.0 mg/dL for males.  Gout is typically defined as a serum uric acid concentration above 7 mg/dL.  Comparatively, in a separate study of the only FDA-approved uricase therapy, 44% of evaluated patients had serum uric acid control below the 6 mg/dL benchmark at week 16.  27% of all current patients in the SEL-212 Phase II trial experienced gout flares during the first month after treatment with continued reduction of gout flare rates over months two to five.  This represents a massive decrease in gout flare ups when compared to the FDA-approved product for uricase.  

The previous data almost concretely demonstrated SEL-212’s potential ability to change the chronic severe gout treatment paradigm by providing better and more sustained serum uric acid control, fewer flares, and less frequent dosing compared retrospectively to the only FDA-approved product.  This upcoming data set has the potential to demonstrate the extended benefit of utilizing SEL-212 in chronic severe gout patients with high medical needs and pave the path to initiating the Phase III trial which is expected to start in Q4 of 2018.  

Phase II data is meant to represent safety of the drug candidate and to see if it is tolerable.  SEL-212 has been generally tolerable at clinically active doses following repeated administrations in the trial, with 17 serious adverse events, 9 of which were reported to not be related to the study drug, 8 were infusion reactions previously reported, and one was an infusion reaction.  No infusion reactions have been reported following the second treatment cycle and all serious adverse events were successfully treated. 


**Market and Competition:**

As previously mentioned, there is only one product on the market that is FDA-approved for uricase, which as the data above demonstrates is much inferior to the current data being presented for SEL-212.  There are over 8 million individuals in the US alone that have gout, with 160,000 suffering from chronic severe gout and are seen by rheumatologists.  Affecting their daily activities and quality of life, over 34% of individuals describe their flares as severe burns and 28% describe it as painful as breaking a bone.  Astonishingly, on average for patients under the age of 65 there are 25 lost work days each year due to lost productivity from severe gout flares.  

The market of gout therapeutics is going to boom in coming years.  Expected to reach a valuation of $8.3 billion by 2025 and growing at a CAGR of 16.1%, the treatment of SEL-212 shows promise to take hold of a massive share in the market.  The market growth is attributed to the major urate-lowering agents, approval of effective biologics, and increasing number of individuals suffering from chronic gout.  Currently because of the lack of effective treatments, Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents (NSAIDs) accounted for the highest share of the market in 2015, which can be credited to highest penetration, higher demand due to low cost, and efficient pain relief.  With the biggest market currently in the US, we are expecting to see a boom in the Asian markets mostly due to increasing quality in health care and better diagnosis of the disease.

The biggest competition in the market includes most notably Horizon Pharma’s gout drug Krystexxa, but also Takeda, Novartis, Savient, AstraZeneca, GSK, Merck, Teijin, and Regeneron. 


**Finances:**

The company has been granted a buy rating with high price expectations by several groups.  This shows promise and great sentiment towards the stock, with their data it is likely they will see high share price in the near future.  The company is however financially stressing at this point.  Their products are all in early stages of development with the exception of the Phase II candidate.  Their chief medical officer also resigned this year with no explanation at the time, causing a bit of worry.  

Their second quarter financial results produced no revenues, down from Q2 2017 due to the company’s grants and collaborations.  Expenses increased by 30% YOY when you compare quarters, a value of $18.8 million for the quarter which resulted in a net loss of $0.84 per share and missing expectations by $0.16.  

As it stands, the company has $66.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and believes that this will be sufficient to fund operations through to Q3 2019.   The current operating plan accounts for funding in preparation for the planned Phase III clinical trial for SEL-212 and initial patient enrollment into a couple of Phase III clinical trial sites, but the company will require an additional equity offering or other external sources of capital to expand enrollment in the Phase III trial and to conduct the planned head-to-head trial against Krystexxa.


**Review:**

This company has a promising pipeline and drug.  The data from the SEL-212 trials so far is incredible when compared to the market competition.  Selecta has several great collaborations with their candidate drugs and has presented almost nothing but good data.  They are making strides in markets that are in demand and have no effective or proper treatments for patients.  They fill an unmet need that will demand a market presence.  

However, beware.  The company is currently in a financial rut, with funds to push operations through for not even the next year, DILUTION IS IMMENENT.  The company will need to raise capital by completing an offering in order to fund their Phase III trials.  I would be absolutely weary of a dilution coming within days of positive news mid October when they present their updated Phase II data.  It would be the perfect time to complete an offering during high investor sentiment as it shows promise and will draw in new investor base. 




#**TLDR**

They are strapped for cash, can only 3 more quarters, will be diluting very soon probably October / November.  I have a FOMO knowing this is a good company &amp; pipeline and that the share price is low from last years over reaction to decent SEL-212 data causing a 50% drop and they did jump over 15% yesterday, but I will still wait. Unpredictable here, up about 30% the past month on expectations, they will get crushed by a dilution and present a perfect buying opportunity.

Context: UMC was caught red handed facilitating the theft of Elpida (now owned by $MU) IP for China.  People were indicted, $MU filed lawsuits.

UMC filed a lawsuit to ""counter"" $MU's lawsuit and it's a big f'n joke; they're suing for $40-50MM USD saying $MU is infringing on their packaging IP, which should give you an idea of what $MU products are banned from sale in China - we're talking specific memory modules/packages, not all of MU's memory or product portfolio.

The provincial government for the court that made the ruling owns a major stake in UMC.

Any restriction of memory product supply to China is EXTREMELY bad for China.  Memory is still in short supply and artificially restricting the Chinese supply will drive up their prices.  Supply from the other companies would be rerouted from other parts of the world to China and then those customers that lost their supply would need to buy from Micron.  [The Rosenblatt analyst called into CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/07/03/is-micron-us-china-trade-war-stock-price-court-patent-united-microelectronics-tariffs-trump.html) and stated that $MU would love to be able to cancel their Chinese contracts and sell their memory at higher prices elsewhere.

I expect the US Government (hopefully the rest of the world) to hit back hard on this, low hanging fruit would be stomping ZTE out of existence.  Additional embargoes would decimate China's tech industry but it would obviously hurt the US economy as well.  This is a shot across the bow of all the worlds' companies that rely on IP and it will not be taken lightly.

I expect more panic selling and $MU to continue to drop.  Obviously, this is concerning but it's not hysterics-inducing.  DO NOT BUY NEAR TERM CALLS, Jan'19s at the earliest.  I'd recommend staying away until this gets properly sorted out - knowing $MU, it'll take much longer to recover than it should so there will be time to buy in when the proverbial storm clouds pass.",2018-07-03 15:46:35,"['MU', 'MU', 'MU', 'MU', 'MU', 'MU', 'MU', 'MU', 'MU', 'MU']"

0,1914,$PCG Distressed Debt Analysis,"With all the WSB bears piling onto PCG shorts I wanted to see what type of outlook the shares are currently reflecting to see if there is long term distressed debt contrarian value here.  As of this writing PCG is trading at 17.40 with a market cap of 13.23 billion.  Before the wildfire liability concern PCG was trading at 48.8 with a market cap of 37.104 billion.  A difference of 23.8748 billion, so investors are extremely worried and starting to price potential bankruptcy.  Theres also news of liability insurance falling short and this is likely exacerbating the issue.  Using wikipedia for reference for some numbers and referencing real estate averages on google I'm attempting to generate a liability range.  Sources and chart included at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

Quick review shows two ongoing fires.  Campe Butte and Woolsey Los Angeles.  Between the two of these there are allegedly 287 people missing or dead, 9620 residential buildings destroyed, 260 commercial buildings destroyed, and 238362 acres of land destroyed.  Camp butte's containment is currently at 40% and Woolsey is at 57%.  

&amp;#x200B;

Using google to get insurance averages, here are some values that I'm using

* Time article for insurance prices human life around 129000.  
* Average residential is 544900.  
* Average commercial is 3302924.  
* Average acre is 7200.

Doing simple average damage so far is \~7.62 billion.  I'm using this as the floor for my estimate.  This would assume that everything is resolved rapidly and no further damage.  The way that I am calculating the high end is that I am doubling the amount due to containment being at 40%, however, this is likely an extremely high estimate because fire damage is exponential, not linear, and likely the worst has already passed.  But there will be lawsuits coming and so will be giving ourselves lots of buffer.  Using the double metric puts damage projections at 15.24 billion.  The high end of my estimate is still 8.63 billion short of how investors are pricing the damage.  

&amp;#x200B;

High damage estimate - 15.24 billion

Low damage estimate - 7.62 billion

Current equity damage estimate - 23.87 billion

Discrepancy from high - 8.63 billion

Discrepancy from low - 16.25 billion

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming we conclude the the fires at the high end of the estimate then PCG could return to trading at 24 with a market cap of 21.9 billion, so still damaged, but far less than currently expected.

&amp;#x200B;

Price target: $24

&amp;#x200B;

This trade will require conclusion of lawsuits and the like, so don't expect this to be resolved by the EOW.  This would be a buy the equity or sell a put credit spread, preferable being put credit spread as that benefits from theta.

0,1929,Digging myself out of the $ATVI hole with covered calls,"I've went through a lot of scenarios and I think selling covered calls on ATVI is the best idea, but I need someone more experienced to help with risk assessment.

The premiums on long dated calls are insane, and I can write 45 covered contracts. For the option I'm thinking of this comes to $30,000 premium. Now from my P/L calculator, this caps me out at a max profit of -$52,500, and max loss is quite a lot if the stock keeps falling. Now the premium alone would cover a lot of the margin, allowing me to hold the stock for a very long time. I'm ok with selling at the strike price too, so if I get assigned even better. My question is, what risks am I taking here? If I'm already ok with selling ATVI at 60, then what is the downside? If I get assigned I keep the premium, sell ATVI at 60 and finally sleep well.

0,1959,Anybody playing $TBPH next week? PDUFA for their new COPD drug is Nov. 13,"\*\*The drug:\*\* Revefenacin (brand name YUPELRI) is a bronchodilator for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). If the FDA approves it, it will be the first long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) on the market that can be taken once daily via nebulizer.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*In English:\*\* COPD is a disease whose symptoms are similar to asthma, but unlike asthma it is typically diagnosed in adults and worsens over time. Patients with COPD can reduce the frequency of exacerbations (flare-ups) by taking long-acting bronchodilators every day, either from an inhaler or from a nebulizer. There are pros and cons to each, and different patients have different preferences, but one advantage of nebulizers is that patients with advanced COPD who have difficulty taking deep breaths often find them easier to use. If it is approved, revefenacin will be the first once-daily drug of its kind for this type of treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Clinical trials:\*\* There are results from three Phase 2 trials on [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov) (\[NCT02109172\]([https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02109172?term=revefenacin&amp;rank=9](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02109172?term=revefenacin&amp;rank=9)), \[NCT02040792\]([https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02040792?term=revefenacin&amp;rank=10](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02040792?term=revefenacin&amp;rank=10)), and \[NCT01704404\]([https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT01704404?term=revefenacin&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=11](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT01704404?term=revefenacin&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=11))). All three showed statistically significant improvement in the primary outcome measure, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), compared to a placebo. The results of Phase 3 trials are not yet posted to the site, but Theravance \[has released some data\]([https://www.empr.com/drugs-in-the-pipeline/yupelri-revefenacin-lama-long-acting-muscarinic-antagonist-copd-exacerbations/article/796275/](https://www.empr.com/drugs-in-the-pipeline/yupelri-revefenacin-lama-long-acting-muscarinic-antagonist-copd-exacerbations/article/796275/)) indicating that revefenacin is more effective than a placebo and comparably effective to tiotropium, a commonly prescribed LAMA that is taken via an inhaler, in reducing the rate of COPD exacerbations.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*The market:\*\* COPD is quite common, affecting more than 65 million people worldwide. In the U.S., where about 15 million people have been diagnosed, COPD is the third most common cause of death. Despite these figures, there don't seem to be a whole lot of treament options for patients who prefer a nebulizer. The first and only (as far as I can tell) nebulized LAMA, a drug called \[glycopyrrolate\]([https://www.pharmacytimes.com/product-news/fda-oks-first-nebulized-lama-copd-treatment](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/product-news/fda-oks-first-nebulized-lama-copd-treatment)) (brand name LONHALA MAGNAIR), hit the market this year after the FDA approved it late last year. It must be taken twice per day, though. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find any information about how well it has sold.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, tiotropium, the drug that Theravance tested revefenacin against in the Phase 3 trial described above, sells extremely well. Produced by Boehringer Ingelheim under the brand name SPIRIVA, it generated \[approximately $3B\]([http://annualreport.boehringer-ingelheim.com/fileadmin/user\_upload/BI\_Annual\_Report\_2017\_EN.pdf](http://annualreport.boehringer-ingelheim.com/fileadmin/user_upload/BI_Annual_Report_2017_EN.pdf)) in revenue for BI last year, despite the fact that some of the patents protecting SPIRIVA have expired. Especially in the U.S., there doesn't seem to be a lot of competition among bronchodilators for COPD.

&amp;#x200B;

Note that LAMAs are not the only treatment options for maintenance of COPD, but there is \[some evidence\]([https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/resp.13100](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/resp.13100)) to suggest that they have fewer adverse effects than common alternatives.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*The company:\*\* With a market cap of $1.3B, Theravance is a small company. It has one drug in production, an antibiotic called VIBATIV, and several others in development. Just prior to yesterday's earnings report, Theravance announced that they are selling VIBATIV to Cumberland Pharmaceuticals for $25M and ""tiered royalties of up to 20%"" (details forthcoming). They did this in order to focus their commercial efforts on marketing and selling revefenacin.

&amp;#x200B;

Theravance won't be going it alone, however. They have partnered with Mylan ($MYLN) for development and commercialization. So far Mylan has covered the costs of Phase 3 trials. If the drug is approved, Mylan and Theravance will share domestic production costs and profits earned. Outside the U.S., Mylan will produce and sell revefenacin and will pay royalties to Theravance. I haven't found many details about the arrangement, though.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*TL;DR:\*\* Theravance Pharmaceuticals ($TBPH) is eagerly awaiting the FDA's decision on November 13th to approve or reject their new COPD drug, revefenacin. Clinical trials have demonstrated that it is more effective than a placebo and comparably effective to tiotropium, a similar drug used in inhalers. If it is approved, revefenacin will be the only once-daily, nebulized COPD drug of its kind. Theravance is apparently so confident that it will be approved that they sold their only drug in production to another company in order to focus their efforts on commercializing it.

Maybe not inconsistencies but, the shit that you won't see &amp; wouldn't think twice about. I'll leave a link to the spreadsheet, but I intentionally left it with values of data only rather than with the formula I used. @MarktetSwingPlay is another to look at - actually the reason for this post because he just came out w/ a tweet mentioning the same ""Range"" my excel sheet showed for this past week. I'm not tryna sound confusing - but long story short, I take a 1Min chart of $SPY each day &amp; export OHLC price, money flow, &amp; volume straight from ETRADE; been doing this since early October. On a 1min chart @ the EOD looking back, there's volume that correlates (almost) perfectly to the amount of $ flow that goes into $SPY - using a HLCC price for each candle, the $ flow / volume (almost) perfectly amounts to either the actual closing price, or the HLCC price. Other times, there's inconsistencies like even this past week that, a ""Money price"" is either MUCH higher, or MUCH lower than where $SPY is trading for that day. It creates a range, &amp; a crystal ass clear cut price that a big buyer or a big seller is ready to act like a wall of resistance, or a trampoline of support. Using excel @ the EOD is dope &amp; all to have the idea ready for the next day &amp; all, but some mf's have whole ass platforms they coded or whatever themselves but like, if this is all there is to it then......... who's good at coding? I'll send the formulas to anyone that's interested in looking more into it but, yeah. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S - Low range &amp; High range were both filled this past week, with more than a few of low range inconsistencies that got targeted. $273.40 low vs. $275.45 high. The excel sheet shows which range is targeted, &amp; ultimately leads to a lower / higher ""target"". Unless a new range is found come monday, High target is $277.52 &amp; low target is $271.34. Selling program was caught @ $272.35 while price was @ $273.16 - so I was surprised @ the rally after seeing the selling pressure. Sheet 1 is a backup, sheet 2 is current. Start on Oct 12th (cell 782). There's data all the way through column ""U"" in case you have to scroll to see it.

I bought $CAT January calls a while ago. Those dipped down about 50% two weeks ago. I decided to capitalize on the dip and bought two week expiries. The two week contracts dipped down 20%, so I added more for a total of 21 contracts. My short-term calls dipped down to -72% the day of the fed announcement. I sold in the morning for a loss. After the announcement Caterpillar rocketed up and continued to rocket up through today. My long term calls crawled back up 120% and I sold this morning for a 6% profit. They closed out at the end of the day at 50% more than what I originally paid for them lol. 

Had I increased my short-term call position the day of the fed announcement, I could have been sitting on $25k today. Hindsight is 20/20.

I'm not sure if I'm just not seeing the market right, or the volatility is just that crazy and I have bad timing. Both times I sold an hour before a huge run-up. Maybe I just have weak hands and need to sack up?

WAITR operates much in the same way as other food delivery services except for its flat fee delivery rate. Whether it’s a $10 order or a $10,000 dollar order the delivery fee is still $5. This is somewhat steep for the individual consumer but they make up for it in business bulk lunch orders where money is saved when using WAITR as opposed to the delivery pricing of other services.

WAITR’s key market strategy is to serve underserved markets in rural and developing towns and cities in the southeast United States. They are growing RAPIDLY and even in markets where they’re in competition with the big boys they’re holding their own with 40% of the market share (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grubhub-rival-just-raised-estimates-144243633.html?.tsrc=rss)

Between $11-14 seems to be a fair entry point for a mid to long position in many’s estimation. The only obstacle may be low number of outstanding shares and low volume. Both of which can be rectified in the future. 

Might be a good chance to long the food delivery market at a low cost. Considering it’s too late to get in  with GrubHub, and considering Postmates and Uber don’t go public till next year the current share price seems more than reasonable.

0,2001,How to buy the dip for easy tendies with high probability,"You'll need to turn on ichimoku cloud, RSI and EMA-200. Those indicators are free on Tradingview or you can use any charting packages. This is not a guarantee that you'll find the lowest dip, but at least you can spot one with high probability. What you're looking for to earn tendies:

* EMA-200 line on top of everything
* The cloud is thinning out (it's the band filled with colors)
* Price candlestick below everything
* RSI dipping below 30

If you have 3 out 4 of those things, it's a 75% chance of being the lowest dip. If 2/4, 50-50 chance.

Example for the dip in 2008 with $SPY (the big crash many moons ago):

Earlier this month, I placed a bear call vertical spread on good ole $TLRY. The spread was at SP 50/45, for expiry on 03/15. 

Thursday I got an early assignment, resulting in about $4.9k of cash credited to my account. I transferred this money from Robinhood into my personal bank account.

Great, well now I can't exit my long position. My long call position has a value of about 2.5k, so I'd like to run with this cash immediately if possible. I don't have the money to exercise. 

When I try to sell my $50 long call, I get a message that says ""Error: You can't place this order because you are selling call contracts while having a short position in the underlying equity."" My RH account shows no short positions in tilray. Additionally, I cannot buy any  stocks as RH claims that I need to cover a margin call, I am strictly on a cash account.

If anybody has any idea why this is happening, please let me know. I've reach out to Robinhood with 0 luck. Thanks.",2018-12-22 14:44:23,['TLRY']

Please feel free to add to the following list:   


# GENERAL NEWS

*CNBC*

*WASHINGTON POST*

*NYT*

*THE TIMES (UK)*

*TELEGRAPH*

*REUTERS*

# INVESTING/ECONOMICS FOCUS

*ECONOMIST*

*BLOOMBERG* 

*FT (Financial Times)*

*THE STREET*

*SEEKING ALPHA*

*YAHOO FINANCE*

*MARKETWATCH*

Personally, I have been using CNBC for general news. I like CNBC because it leans towards being market focused while still keeping me updated on macro-political events and its FREE!                                                                                       
Bloomberg &amp; Seeking Alpha (non-sub) for investing/economic news. And finally, I love Yahoo Finance for creating watchlists. 

I have never paid a subscription for any news source because honestly I would rather lose $30 a month on far out of the money options on $MU.  


What are your favorite new sources? Let me know why you prefer it over the others.

Hope everyone is enjoying losing all their money in this volatile market to the GOLDMAN SACHS overlords.

0,2012,$REV - Short Squeeze in the Making,"Through all the volatility in the marketplace, REV - on no positive news - has been posting steady gains day over day since the 5th. All in all a \~30% increase.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a well written [thesis](https://moxreports.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Long-Rev-Sep-2018-Final.pdf) explaining the dynamics at play. \~85% of the shares have been accumulated by Perelman with an intent to go private. The majority of remaining shares are owned by Mittleman Brothers LLC who have explictly expressed intent to refuse any go private offers that do not reflect the intrinsic value of the stock - which they place in the range of $50.

&amp;#x200B;

With the vast majority of share owned by players with no intent to sell, the amount of trade-able shares / float is exceedingly small and shrinking. 2.7 million shares are shorted with a daily volume \~250K. As the major players increase their share in advance of going private, and others buy and hold in anticipation of a tender offer, traded shares continues to shrink.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact that REV has continued to climb - from $20 on the 5th to $26 today without any signs of pullback despite a volatile market - underscores the extent price is being driven by these dynamics with the float. It would seem to be to Perelman's advantage to initiate a tender offer sooner, rather than later as this run-up increase. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is some threshold where a short squeeze will accelerate. With 30% sustained gains over the past two weeks, it is likely shorts covering positions are driving some of the existing movement already.

*BIIB098 (Formerly ALKS 8700) – Phase III for Multiple Sclerosis

*ALKS 4230 – Phase I in Immuno-oncology


Alkermes has two big FDA deadlines and events in the upcoming months which will be the focus of this write up.  The first is ALKS 5461 for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder with the FDA advisory committee discussing the NDA application for the drug candidate on November 1st as well as a PDUFA date of January 31, 2019.  The second is ALKS 4230 for treatment of Solid Tumors, where they are reporting Phase I initial data in the second half of 2018.  I will be setting 2 dates for this write up to remind investors of the Advisory Meeting/data presentation sometime in the next 2 months, as well as the PDUFA date of January 31, 2019.  With multiple catalysts in the pipeline in the next 3 months, Alkermes is an exciting company to watch.


**Specific Drugs:**

**ALKS 5461**

AKLS 5461, buprenorphine/samidorphan, is a k-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist which functions as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy in treatment-resistant depression (TRD).  The buprenorphine is a partial agonist of µ-opioid receptors (MOR), antagonist of the KOR, as well as a slight antagonist of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR), and a weak agonist of the nociception receptor (NOP).  Samidorphan on the other hand is a preferential antagonist of the MOR, allowing for the combination of the two to function as a stopper to KORs with negligible activation of MORs.  
Essentially this means that by activating the KOR, opioid peptides which are endogenous ligands of the KOR and function by inversing morphine-like, euphoric endorphins, create a sense of dysphoria and psychotomimetic effects, and are to produce changes in neuroplasticity evoked by chronic stress that has led to the development of depression and CNS disorders and drug addiction.  It is suggested in research that inhibiting the KOR abolishes antidepressant-like effects of buprenorphine, but the drug exhibits both antagonistic and agonist properties.  This has led to the concern that in theory, ALKS-5461 could be limited in the effectiveness of treatment of depression.  

Granted a Fast Track Designation in 2013, the drug has proceeded up to Phase III where thee different trials were initiated for the treatment of depression.  The first two trials failed in 2016, FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, however based on the third trial, FORWARD-5, the company submitted an NDA in 2017 for ALKS-5461.  Things started to look grim for the company moving forward, as the FDA served Alkermes a refuse-to-file letter saying that more data from well-controlled clinical trials must be presented before an application would be recognized.  However, just two weeks after serving the notice, the FDA rescinded their letter and accepted the NDA after productive interactions with Alkermes where the company clarified certain aspects of the NDA.  No further data was needed to rescind the letter and PDUFA date is scheduled by January 31, 2019.

The first two trials failed after the company reported higher placebo responses as the chief obstacle in their studies.  Not something a company would like to hear in relation to an antidepressant medication.  Causing the stock to plummet 44% in 2016, from nearly $80 to under $40, the company has been slowly recovering since.  ALKS-5461’s fate lies in the hands of FORWARD-5, without a clear success and perfect data, an FDA approval seems unlikely for this drug. 

FORWARD-5 focused on two doses of 1mg/1mg and 2mg/2mg of ALKS-5461 for adjunct treatment in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).  Concurrently to taking ALKS-5461, the patients also remained on background antidepressant therapy.  With 407 patients enrolled, 63 received 1mg/1mg, 63 received 2mg/2mg, and 280 received the placebo.  The study was conducted in two stages: Stage 1 was 5 weeks, Stage 2 was 6 weeks. In Stage 1, the average change from baseline depression scores was calculated for weeks 3 through 5. For Stage 2, the average change was calculated for weeks 3 through 6. Depression scores were assessed using the 6-item Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-6) and MADRS-10, an assessment tool for depression.

In the study, ALKS-5461 2mg/2mg met the prespecified primary endpoint of significantly reducing depression scores compared to placebo, as measured by 6-item MADRS scores (p=0.018). ALKS-5461 2mg/2mg also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in 10-item MADRS scores compared to placebo (p=0.026). The 1mg/1mg dose of ALKS-5461 showed improvement in depressive symptoms in the study, but did not separate significantly from placebo.  2mg/2mg treatment did show a significant change, warranting its efficacy while also having no incidences of withdrawal or pattern of adverse effects suggesting abuse potential.  The clinical benefit of the compound maintained through 11-week study and the compound is relatively safe and tolerable.  Where FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4 failed to meet their endpoints, FORWARD-5 succeed in meeting primary endpoint for the 2mg/2mg dose, showing great efficacy when compared to a placebo.   
November 1st, 2018, the FDA advisory committee is meeting to discuss ALKS-5471 in relation to the compound’s efficacy, safety and risk-benefit profile of the NDA for buprenorphine and samidorphan sublingual tablets for adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder.  In recent history, the FDA has gone against the decision and vote of the advisory committee roughly 10% of the time over all, with 30% of the votes being against approving the drug and 70% of the votes being for approval.  

**ALKS-4230**

Currently in Phase I of development, Alkermes does a change of pace with this immuno-oncology drug for the treatment of solid tumors, making a shift away from their regular market in the CNS disease space.  This drug candidate is an engineered fusion protein comprised of permuted interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2 Receptor (IL-2R) α made specifically to only activate the intermediate-affinity IL-2R.  The intermediate-affinity IL-2R is expressed mainly on effector lymphocytes, which are essential in generating an antitumor immune response.  IL-2 is a cell signaling molecule which plays a role in controlling the life cycle of specialized T-cells.  ALKS-4230 selectively binds to intermediate-affinity IL-2R to both activate and increase in number the immune cells that work to battle cancer.  Their selectivity, however, means they don’t bind to the “high-affinity IL-2 receptor,” so as not to trigger greater activity or proliferation in immune cells that could dampen an anti-tumor response Research has suggested that selective activation of the intermediate-affinity IL-2R by ALKS-4230 has the potential to provide enhanced tumor killing as well as improved tolerability. 
ALKS-4230 is currently in Phase I in patients with advanced solid tumors. Key study objectives are to determine a recommended phase 2 dose and characterize the safety profile, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and evidence of antitumor activity. A dose-escalation phase in patients with refractory solid tumors (Part A) will be followed by expansion cohorts in defined populations (Part B). ALKS 4230 is administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion once daily for five days each cycle. The dose will be escalated until reaching maximum tolerated dose or an Optimal Biologic Dose. The first two dose cohorts will use a 3+3 design. Subsequent cohorts in Part A will enroll a minimum of 6 subjects. In Part B up to 21 patients will be enrolled into each of four tumor-specific cohorts. Peripheral blood samples will be collected for PK, immunogenicity and PD assessments. The primary PD endpoint is change-from-baseline in CD8+ T, NK and T reg cell counts. Other PD measures include serum concentrations of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and immunohistochemical assessment of markers of immune activation in tumor tissue from selected patients. 

Animal trials conducted previously were positive and showed the anti-tumor activity of ALKS-4230, both alone and with the checkpoint inhibitors. Rodents treated with ALKS-4230 were seen to have lesser tumor growth and better survival, supporting clinical evaluation of ALKS 4230 as a potential immunotherapy in the oncology space. ALKS-4230 will be administered in combination with PD-1 inhibitor KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab). Pembrolizumab is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells, complimenting the mechanisms of action from ALKS-4230.  Alkermes has accelerated clinical evaluation of ALKS 4230 in combination with pembrolizumab based on data from the ongoing monotherapy dose-escalation stage of the phase 1 study, where ALKS 4230 demonstrated dose-dependent pharmacodynamic effects on circulating natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells, and minimal and non-dose dependent effects on immunosuppressive regulatory T cells.  

Initial data from Phase I is due in the second half of 2018, estimated to come out early November.


**Competition and Market:**

ALKS-4230 is a tough market, cancer is a hot sector but it continually sees failure.  While the FDA holds the stance that they want to try to push new oncology and immuno-oncology drugs through the approval process and get them to market to potentially save or extend lives, their decisions tend to skew otherwise.  Being so early on in development, it’s not necessary to dive into the market in depth as there is a large, unmet need in the oncology sector with the main focus being in immuno-oncology.

MDD has a multifaceted and varied etiology, and remains poorly understood. The MDD market is overly crowded and overly competitive, surpassing 30 FDA approved products available for the treatment of patients, the majority of which are now available as inexpensive generics. The MDD market is currently in an active transition where patents are expiring on top-selling products such as Eli Lilly's Cymbalta and Otsuka/BMS' Abilify, paving way for launches of Lundbeck/Takeda's Trintellix and Otsuka/Lundbeck's Rexulti.  These will create a significant growth in the market as cheaper generics will become available.  Growth in the MDD market is also expected to be driven by the potential introduction of numerous promising late-stage pipeline products into the market during the next few years which are directed at treatment-resistant patients.  These products include Alkermes' ALKS-5461, Allergan/Gedeon Richter/Mitsubishi Tanabe's Vraylar, Axsome Therapeutics' AXS-05, Janssen's esketamine, and Allergan's rapastinel.

MDD is the most common mental disorder in the U.S., affecting approximately 16 million American adults, of which about one-third remain untreated. The number of treated patients is projected to rise on account of expiring patents, the increase in available generic products, and rising awareness regarding depression and mental health issues.  This competitive market was priced at a massive $3.2 billion in 2015 and is expected to consistently grow at a CAGR of 6.1% until 2025 to reach $5.8 billion.  With the current social standings of mental health, students being required to take mandatory mental health courses now in many places, and social workers and therapists being more commonplace in schools and work places, we should see a larger surge in my opinion.  Growing female prevalence, increase in prescription spending, and escalating awareness of mental health will propel the growth of this market for many years to come.


**Financials:**

Alkermes has a great financial standing in the biotech industry.  Leveraging both their approved products and impressive collaborations, the company was able to boast a revenue growth of 39% ($304.6 million) through product sales and payments.  Many opportunities lined up for the company and set them up for success this second quarter. 

*Vivitrol sales increased 15% to $76.2 million

*Aristada sales increased 48% to $33.6 million

*Royalties from Johnson &amp; Johnson partnership increased 4% to $85.2 million

*Royalties from Acorda Therapeutics decreased 22% to $19.7 million

*License revenue from Biogen generated $48.3 million in revenue


Despite increased operation costs related to commercializing their products and further research and development, the company posted a Non-GAAP net income of $45.6 million and a Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.29. With a total cash balance of $561 million and total debt of $280 million, the company stands on strong ground.  This second half of 2018 has several catalysts, combined with increasing revenues from collaborations and drug approvals, Alkermes is likely to see success, only to be complimented by hopefully positive data from their upcoming Phase I and PDUFA dates. The company is expecting to hit $1 billion in revenues for 2018 as a year, which would be a massive milestone for the pharmaceutical company.


**Review:**

Historically, the FDA has been flexible with depression medications, but failures will weigh Alkermes down.  Depression studies have had a flurry of failures over recent history, and failure here can dissuade further research in the pharmaceutical space until more is known on the biology side.  With over 30 currently approved products on the market for MDD, it is overly saturated and failure can spell the end for the drug.  Following their failures in FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, investors are weary of another failure, especially after the initial NDA was rejected.  Good news is, there is an advisory committee meeting in November to discuss ALKS-5461. In recent history, the FDA has gone against the decision and vote of the advisory committee only about 10% of the time over all, with 30% of the votes being against approving the drug and 70% of the votes being for approval.  Chances are from that perspective that the FDA will grant approval.  The compound also shows no suggestion of tolerance of therapeutic effects, the side effect profile was generally comparable to standard medications with no significant late appearing side effects, and when medication was halted there was no sign of opioid withdrawal.  With the competitive, growing market and patents expiring, a new and novel MDD treatment would be a value add.

In the case of the early stage ALKS-4230, oncology drug candidates historically have a 57% possibility of success moving from Phase I to Phase II compared to an industry average of 63.2% possibility of success.  This does shine in comparison to the oncology end success rate of a low 3.4%.  If I were to put my money where my mouth is, I am going with the data and not the suggestive words of the FDA to say that oncology might sound like a great industry with the backing of the FDA, but their actions prove otherwise.  Oncology drugs are more likely to be denied by the FDA and fail their clinical trials at much higher rates than other industries such as vaccines which show an end rate of success over 30%.  I would guess this drug might make it to Phase III with time, but statistically it is unlikely to see approval.  While Phase III or even Phase II are years away from completion, the data in Phase I will likely reveal a lot about the drug to make future estimations off of.  I see Phase I being positive.

Currently the stock is trading around $43 and showing a high level of support and consolidation in this zone.  With a high of over $70 not 7 months ago, the company is likely to recover and soar.  This stock does not take bad news well however, seeing several 10% or more drops over the past year, but never going under $40 for long.  I think between $42-46 are great entries for this stock.  Long term their finances are growing, increasing revenues from royalties and sales of their own approved products, on track to hit $1 billion in revenues this year, and a solid pipeline that shows great promise.  I would bank on good data from ALKS-4230 as well as a positive hearing from the advisory committee.  With the PDUFA date in January, we will see a heavy run up into the end of the year.  I would take advantage of this price entry for either a long-term hold or a swing trade.  I would predict levels of up to $55 in the coming 3 months.

So stock basically back to where it was a month ago. Why, because dis gold digging bitch (https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/cristiano-ronaldo-kathryn-mayorga-filmed-13366084, judge for yourself) sued CR7, and is causing reputational damage for Juventus. For a stock that trades on sentiment this is obviously not good.

However Juventus seems to be supporting CR7 (https://twitter.com/juventusfcen/status/1047912523494842370) so I don't think he will be dropped unless some real shit happens. 

On the pitch Juventus is destroying everybody, so fundamentally the team is doing well. More wins, more views, more merchandise, more money. That's basically the direction right now. I don't think the lawsuit will impact that, at least not yet.

Sold my near 10 bagger at its peak for less than a double (1.1 and 1.2 December warrants), and rolled it into 1.5 that was offering 7x based on my target of 2. If you are wondering how I made money that now I may lose on the 1.5s that's because IV shot through the roof. The eurofags pricing these literally just dialed it up from 30s to over 100 at one point. Now it's around 70.

Key events:

1. Lawsuit progress, so far CR7 is denying everything, hasn't gone all out war yet like suing back.
2. Winning more games
3. Earnings in November.

To win: Need &gt; 50% votes in the election. If not there's gonna be a run off on the 28th between the first two places.

Next week you might be able to play Short or Long $SQ

**Long:**

There is support at $60 which was tested a couple of times back in May and July (See Blue Line). Should that support hold, the next test would be a well established descending trend line (see Orange line) that should come into play next week. If Square can break that trend line there won't be another resistance level until around $74 (see the Yellow line). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Short:** 

If the $60 support line is broken next week, load up on puts because the next support won't be until $40, test numerous times in May. ",2018-12-14 22:53:55,"['SQ', 'SQ']"

0,2193,2 for 2 noobs. Third move - $COST 195 Calls,"Rule #1 - Never get greedy!

Anyone that bought AMC calls low and sold when it doubled made it out like bandits. Shoutout to the scrub that accused me of Dunning Kruger. Dude, being happy about a huge gain isn't DK syndrome GTFO.

Next move - Barnes and Noble. We all knew it would miss, but those of us that don't like being IV crushed bought puts and sold before the conference call. I personally got in (3/16 5.00 Put) at .6 and out at .8 -- some did better but fuck it 33% is 33%.

Next - Costco. I picked up some 3/9 195 Calls. Going to do a premium play here. AKA dump these before earnings or 50% gain - whichever comes first. Either way should be in the green IMO. 

[Sales trends](https://www.nasdaq.com/article/is-costco-cost-set-to-beat-earnings-estimates-cm929014) overwhelmingly favor a beat. This matters for different reasons though, since the plan isn't to hold through earnings. Positive sentiment (+ a slow run-up in the next five trading days) is clearly going to pump up the value of the premiums.

Case in point : a $1.87 haircut down to the high 180s only knocked the call in question down 37 cents. Options traders clearly agree COST is in good position with its sales and guidance (they selling cars now wtf?)

I don't feel like getting gangbanged by IV, so I wouldn't hold through earnings, but this is clearly a nice premiums play for novice traders like me.

COST 3/9 $195 Calls to the moon. Currrently $2.23 - consider the boat missed if you can't get in before $2.50. If you can, free money IMO.

This was too far. For some reason, I don’t typically unsubscribe from text alerts (I still get alerts from this pizza joint in a city 2000 miles from where I currently live), but this was too far. Every fucking day Facebook is blowing me up with notifications asking:

Did you see &lt;chick that got pregnant in high school&gt;’s new photo?

Did you see &lt;old lady I’m somehow related to&gt;’s comment on &lt;one of her old lady friends who I’m not friends with&gt;s photo?

Let me make this clear Facebook, I couldn’t give less of a flying fuck. But that’s not what it’s about, right?

They claimed to offer ""disruptive solutions for Fintech, Targeted Marketing, Predictive, Analysis, Market Research, Competitor Analysis, and Consumer Behavior Analysis.  A couple months ago their they release an extremely optimistic forward guidance expected to quintuple in 2018. They have an institutional holding of 16.38% which is quite substantial and notably one of their investor is CP group, a Thai Congolmerate who were the first to enter China when they opened their market to the world. Now this means absolutely nothing as they have money to throw around but it is important to consider that MARK has the eye of big investors. Unfortunately recent events have devastated the stocks and have investors scared. 

.

If you have not read about it, this was the Reddit I heard about it from. https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/7ctau5/you_need_to_check_out_ai_led_remark_holdings_mark/

MARK shows some weakness in their management and public relations as recent events unfolded but it uncertain what maybe the cause of it. The recent bogus report that claim MARK was fradulent was eventually deletedhttps://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2018_02_06_mark_external.pdf, but stocks eventually tumbled under 10$ which show never had happened. Unfortunately MARK's weak rebuttal that was clean and clear but vague on exactly what they do perhaps to maintain secrecy against other AI companies. Their CFO have also recently sold his shares. Now this may mean nothing at all and perhaps we can give them the benefit of the doubt and this is where part of the risk comes from. They could simply be fully focused on developing KanKan while maintaining their other subsidiaries, but without investors that cannot succeed. I'm pretty sure the people who were on margins were devastated. And because MARK is a small market cap they could simply be inexperienced with public relations.

.

The other part of the risk is simply KanKan is a unproven technology in their early stages.  Claims are simply claims, one that stood out to me is that they claim KanKan's War Room is like no other. This is just one of their many bold claim like quintupling of their AI revenue. But let see.

The reason why MARK stocks went up last week started with a confirmed contract, and days earlier before these event they showed an example of KanKan, followed by a report by Shanghai university.

On March 6 MARK signed a contract with 7/11 Thailand to deploy KanKan through 11,000 stores that is owned by CP group. This is incredibly important, CP group is not only investing but also implementing them into their system.  https://twitter.com/RemarkHoldings/status/970994294453604353 It goes without saying you shouldn't invest in something you don't understand and invest in what you use like shaq's wheaties/fruity pebbles deal. Now the example they showed (March 2), showed absolutely nothing of value to the everyday investor, https://twitter.com/RemarkHoldings/status/969595666040147970 I am not tech expert but I am pretty sure its complex to track movements.

On March 8, Shanghai university wrote a report on Kankan which is unfortunately deleted. https://twitter.com/jgrim375/status/971809430776971268?s=19 I actually forgot but I do remember they are would like to enter the Japanese market, although a weak growth economy they have a market opened to innovation. In a country high dependent on tech this would be fantastic if they could.

Other big news that I don't think people caught on was Ping-An on cnbc spoke to use their AI system. And guess what AI they are planning to use. Your's truly KanKan. I don't think most people caught on since they didn't specifically state KanKan. https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/08/17/ping-an-is-far-ahead-in-using-a-i-in-the-insurance-business-exec.html

We want a a strong China in the coming months. We do not want a recession but that recession will not becaused by the steel and aluminum tariffs. There are a helluva more things that can topple the Chinese market before this. According to federal info we receive only 2-4% of steel from China, the concern with this is that there is some belief that steel is being shipped through transshipment by shipping raw material to other countries before the entering the US and that is what we record. Tracking transshipping is incredibly hard so it is uncertain. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/08/angus-king/does-much-steel-does-us-import-china/ But shipping steel is also really heavy and expensive it would be absurd to transship (this is purely my opinion it wouldn't surprise me that china is doing it like russia is murdering journalists), there are claims that china is flooding that the market with steel at a loss  in order to curb production but of course china dismisses this. http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36099043

So why is this important, it is not. This will not affect MARK as long as mark can attract subscription based customers from any market sectors.

Forget 7/11, who the hell cares in fact, we want China and Japan but more importantly CHINA. Forget the tiny deal with 7/11. China is leaning towards being wallet free in major cities. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75AXINUL47g Where we concern ourselves with privacy in the states. The chinese have allowed Alibaba and Tencent access to massive amount of consumer data. In china everyone is paying with either alipay or wechat (tencent). KanKan's supposed ability would be an invaluable tool and entering the Japanese market who are obviously technologically advance would be just another happy aneurysm.

other stuff mark do and there are more this is one of them - credit score through social media that banks in china uses as a credible source.
.

The dip that came on Friday, and it is barely a dip dropping only 12 cents. MARK still shows some strong RSI. EDIT infact it is back up today.

.

TLDR: Don't fear MARK. Invest in what your willing to lose. I am absolutely not responsible for your decisions. Do your own DD.

0,2275,$MARK Recap,"Several months ago, Mark forward guidance expected a quintuple in their revenue. The once promising company that failed to delivered has once again revitalize interest with their AI Kankan. They have an incredibly potent AI system, with high hopes expressed by a 16.38% institutional, notably CP group which were the first to enter the China when theey open their market to the world. Now this means nothing but it certainly has the eyes of large investors.

And if you haven't read a few months ago by the redditor that I found out from. https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/7ctau5/you_need_to_check_out_ai_led_remark_holdings_mark/

With the bogus claim that got deleted a few weeks ago, it toppled $MARK price below 10 which should have never happened, it presents an excellent buy a few days ago and is still a perfectly fine time to buy into, with the dip that came this friday and maybe for the next few days but it is expected to break 10 next week. They also have some serious RSI. BUT how the management reacted show some serious weakness in their public relations and management in general but also their CFO sold his positions. Their rebutal was clean and clear but vague. Following the day or two they tried to present old news of being part of the 2017 Deloitte Technology 500 and pathetically saying, ""Excited for what we will do in 2018"" (https://twitter.com/RemarkHoldings/status/969376667905900544). Perhaps this is nothing and because they are a small market cap, they are just simply inexperience with public relations and devoting all their focus towards KanKan while maintaining their other subsidiaries.

The reason why $MARK grew earlier this week (March 6) was the confirm contract with 11,000 7/11 stores in Thailand followed by an paper published by shanghai university. https://twitter.com/RemarkHoldings/status/970994294453604353?s=19

And days before they showed us an example of KanKan (March 2). https://twitter.com/remarkholdings/status/969595666040147970?s=19

On March 8 shanghai uni publish their analysis of KanKan. The paper showed high hopes in not only China but also and just maybe they can enter the Japanese market. Even though Japan is weak economically for growth there is still a market opened for innovation. http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Mf--fg9cQMIJ:www.shtvu.org.cn/_upload/article/files/03/56/60a4c3f846a38e8010aba6ff81c4/30329619-639c-4411-8139-d2445dd9f74c.pdf

Now as for Tariffs, it will not budge Remark but more importantly it will not budge China. It is said that we only get 4-2% of steel from China as of federal information. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/08/angus-king/does-much-steel-does-us-import-china/ But there is worry that it maybe even more than that through transshipping by shipping steel from china to another country before reaching the US as we record that information only but tracking this is incredibly difficult and steel is heavy and expensive (and the supposed reason why china is doing this to curb overproduction and perhaps they are selling at a loss http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36099043) It would most likely affect strain our relations with out allies instead. But more importantly we want China to maintain their economy and because if the tariff affects the Chinese market and it shouldn't and there are more ways for China to go into a recession before this. Mark shouldn't be affected as long as they continue to attract more subscription base customers from any market sector that would need or want KanKan.

$NVDA is a gaming company. It has been since its inception. Most recently, Nvidia has been big into Artificial intelligence. Most headlines reference something to do with AI. I think this transition from gaming to AI is important for Nvidia's growth in the next decade. My price target for them is a 40% upside, $329. Is that even possible given how much it's grown this past year? I think so. 


[Here is the google drive with the model paper, and position proof, updated whenever I update them](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h2cTeiNRP07K8-2Wn4lYyQtbB_go2HGB?usp=sharing)


I'm just going to go over some catalysts and some risks:


Catalysts


* New GeForce series using the new Volta architecture, Series 20. Announcement will be big, should be in March 2018. The already released GPUs with Volta have been successful, I expect that trend to continue.

* Two years until we are seeing some of Nvidia's big autonmous vehicles come to life. Both the driving platform they are developing in china with ZF and Baidu, and the Volkswagen VW AI-infused Bus are expected to be actualized in 2020. If we see some success in the execution of these projects, I'd consider it a catalyst. I'm confident their execution will be successful given the success they've already demonstrated in AI with their datacenter revenue.


Risks:


* Semiconductor industry decline. The semiconductor industry is interesting because a decline in one can cause they others to underperform. This is an entire topic on its own.


* AMD/new GPU designer taking market share from Nvidia. Unlikely, but Nvidia's dominance in the GPU market is why I am so bullish. I want to invest in the leader of AI deep learning training hardware and graphics processing, not the second best.


* Jensen Huang, the CEO, losing his ability to lead the company. Nvidia has has successfully positioned themselves to be a part of the future of AI, which I think is accredited to Huang's execution. This is a positive, he's invested in the company. The downside to this is that he is very important and anything that hurts his ability to lead would hurt Nvidia.


Price Target:


* I used a DCF model to arrive at the price target of $329, using a 7% discount rate and 1% perpetual growth rate. In the model I assume 39% revenue growth in Nvidia's 2019 fiscal year, 32% in 2020, and 28% in 2021. I based this off their plans in autonomous driving, and their new GeForce series to be released with Volta architecture. 


What I think:


I think Nvidia successfully integrating its hardware into so many big company's is a huge success for their long term goals. Nvidia hardware is being utilized in Tesla's electic car's autopilot 2.0, and used by Google and Amazon Web Services datacenters. Nvidia is so dominant that no one can take these positions unless the company wants to build their own chips, which would be billions of dollars in R&amp;D. Nvidia is supplying hardware for these big companies and there is no one to compete.


I have +1 Jan 19 NVDA $350 Call that I purchased for $8.30. Proof in drive. Why not investing more? I don't want a lot of exposure and I'm poor.


TLDR: NVIDIA is investing into AI. Nvidia's Drive PX 2 operates Tesla's autopilot 2.0 system, Nvidia's new Tesla GPUs have grown datacenter revenue by 133% this last year, and their focus on the narrow AI to bring autonomous vehicles on the road is proving to be worth it. $329, long equity.

original question  “so what’s the EPS looking like for the upcoming quarter?”

My friend's rephrasing: Something about Wall Street something something projections.

WMT: *explanation of what went wrong last q and why it'd go up.*

editor's note: Girl next to me had her hand on my leg, I don't fully remember everything word for word.

----
Question: ""AMD?""

Rephasing: ""IOT?""

WMT: We current have partnerships with Tencent to something something data science. We also own 10% of JD.*

Editor's note: Not sure if Walmart owns 10% of JD or him and other people sitting there own 10%. Probably Walmart, I'd give it a 90% chance.


----
Original question: ""Wage increase""
Walmart: Tax reformed lowered our tax from 33% and 23%. Rather than doing share buyback we rose wages to $11.50 because *something something accounting this is better for company.*

Editor's note: Basically, whenever I used italics, blame it on blonde sorority chicks.


-----
Orginal question: ""Walmart’s future plans for an Uber partnership.""
WMT: *something about working with locals and getting them to deliver for us. Towers rather than lockers? Something about that*


----
Original question: ""How do you compete with Amazon.""
Walmart: *Something about maintaining originality. It's important to have differences. They're using machine learning and AI more though. I think he said Alibaba at some point.*

After buying again I noticed the same *phenomena* happened with the ask and bid so I averaged down again... and again...

To begin: delta 1, or d1, is a broad term that can really refer to any asset with a delta of 1, i.e. non-options, futures, swaps, outright stock, etc. Obviously that's over-simplifying it but for an introduction it's good enough. In particular, I'll be looking at the 3month future roll on ES contracts, the roll being the spread between the June and Sep levels which is currently at $3.75. 

How is the price of the roll determined? Rates and dividends exclusively. Let's say the ES June future trades around 2800, but today you can buy every stock in the S&amp;P 500 for a price that lets you recreate the ES index for an equivalent price of 2790. Your today to June roll is worth $10. So if you buy all the individual stocks today and sell the June future, then you can just hold the stock until June when your counterparty will buy the equivalent of your stock position off of you (ignoring that quarterly expirations are cash settled). That would imply you would have just scalped the $10 difference in valuations between spot price and futures price. In reality though, when you buy all that stock that you want to carry to June it is assumed you borrow money to do so and that you will pay interest on that amount. That's the **cost of carry** for the trade and if it costs you any less than $10 to borrow that money to buy stocks then you will have effectively arbed the rates market, e.g. $2790 for the stock and $9 in interest is $2799 to get long, and then selling the future for $2800 is a $1 arb. 

Of course as an index each individual stock has the potential to pay out a dividend. Let's say Apple is the only stock in the index paying one out and it's paying out $5 per share. Now the same trade from before nets you an extra $5 because you're holding the actual Apple stock and will receive that dividend for carrying the position to June. So effectively you can pay $5 more to buy the stock and still get away with a clean arb, i.e. pay $2795 today + $9 interest - $5 dividend (you receive this cash flow) = $2799, and then sell the future for 2800.

Now that we know how a roll should be fairly calculated, let's go back to the concept of cash settlement that I mentioned before. If a position is a delta netural long stock, short future position, then when the future expires and settles into cash the position will be long stock only, meaning there is now a delta exposure which is a risk. One way to cover this risk is to flatten the position of the expiring futures contract by rolling it to the next futures contract. So again, using long stock short June future, buying the June future back whilst selling the Sep future (known as selling the roll) means that the position is long stock short Sep future and will stay delta neutral once the June future expires. 

**Here's the cool part.** Because every trader who knows how to trade is hedging their exposure to this June future expiring, the 3 month roll around quadruple witching time can trade so far away from theoretical that it's possible for even retail investors to jump in on the action. For anyone following the term structure of SPX you'll know that June is trading very expensive due to all the macro events going on. Since market makers tend to be short expensive vol it is likely they are short gamma in June. With the recent rally, that short gamma equates to short deltas which need to be covered by selling the roll and is exactly what we're seeing with the 3 month roll trading well below fair value. This means that the Sep future is trading too cheap vs June and the pricing of options in Sep will be skewed because of it. 

So for those of you that managed to get through all that and understand it, congrats you now have your next EV+ trading idea. For those of you that didn't, **all in $MU**.

0,2422,Quick note for you guys trading $BRZU,"Some of you guys trading Brazil ETFs may have wondered why they were green yesterday, when Brazil is f'd.  

Well, nothing changed, Brazil is still f'd. The Bovespa index was down 1.23%, Petrobras was down over 3%. What happened was that, the night before, Brazil's central bank head announced that they'd use every tool at their disposal to stop currency devaluation, short of raising interest rates (a politically loaded issue). As a result BRL was up 6% against the USD yesterday, and suddenly Brazilian stocks became 6% more expensive for you gringos.  

Personally I think the relief will be short-lived. Back in the Dilma era the Brazilian central bank burned a ton of cash issuing swap contracts, with little effect. However note that this time they hinted they may pull out the big guns (Brazil is sitting on a 382 billion USD reserve). Also note that it works both ways, if (when, imo) BRL depreciation resumes, losses for USD-denominated Brazil ETFs will be amplified.

The IV chart [confirmed](https://i.imgur.com/XtXgXlT.png).

You know what this means!  Of course not, because you dipshits have no idea what you're doing with options trading.  Let me elaborate.

You can **sell** the FDs.  Yes, I know this is a foreign concept.  ""But then I have high/unlimited risk!  What if I get assigned!""  You can then cover the risk of selling these by buying the same strike in July.  [Here's an example](https://i.imgur.com/DGnKwb1.png).  I'd reference a link for calendar spreads for further information, but we all know it would be a waste of time.

If the short FDs expire worthless on Friday, you can liquidate your long options up to a maximum profit of around $80 per spread ($1600 in my example using 20 contracts per leg).  If the trade moves outside the break even points ($32.58 and $36.33 in my example), you can close out at about a $20 loss per spread.  Of course, you can always just manage the assignment (market sell the shares or maybe sell a covered call on them), and continue selling FDs with your long contracts as protection for the next few weeks.

**FORECAST**

None

**WHAT TO EXPECT**

Predicted: Red

Results: Boring. $SPY opened at $265.26 and closed at $265.90. 

My record, so far: 7/9.

**ANY REVISIONS?**

No revisions since I'm posting this just a few hours before the markets open today (doesn't seem fair).

**ANYTHING ELSE?**

TPP talks: Trump already Tweeted that he won't accept it as-is, sets his sights on Japan.

Bank earnings reports: Should provide a bit of a boost today, but $WFC seems like it will be a drag, and with all of this political shit going on, I'll be surprised if the markets go up much. 

Syria: Haven't been able to find anything definitive on this, but if I had to guess, we'll get news this afternoon that Trump just leveled a city or some shit. Just in time for him to go play golf.

Mueller: Just another potential catalyst.

I'm in a rush this morning, so I can't flesh out everything with my usual level of detail, but I'll try to make it up to you guys tonight.

#*$ADMP - Adamis Pharma*

This fuckin thing must have been a nightmare for any investor who bought over the past year. Dropping from $9 to sub $3 in June after running up from $6 to $11 over the course of April-May.  Since last June this stock has been a roller coaster jumping up and down between $2.50 and $5-6.00.  Luckily for you fucks (maybe not Idk yet havent looked into it as Im typing other than the chart) this thing is sitting at $3.30 right at a support zone that has held really the past year despite many drops under momentarily.  Could be a good sign for buying, lots of spikes following it touching $3.00 but then again T/A is fuckin useless to so many of you nerds it probably doesnt matter.  I could just say buy here and end the analysis because you probably wont read a fuckin thing other than the TLDR at the end where I will say probably buy or dont, but I want the science baby.

#Overview

This company focuses on developing and commercializing compounds in therapeutic areas of respiratory disease and allergies.  Since healthcare is expensive and shit, this company wants to focus on low-cost alternatives to existing therapies in its target market and hit a larger range of patients.  Basically the China of biotech.   

Based out of San Diego (love that city), They have a few different products in their pipelines.  

Their flagship product is Symjepi, an epinephrine injection for emergency treatment for allergic reactions to stinging and biting insects, allergen immunotherapy, foods, drugs, diagnostic testing substances and other allergens, as well as idiopathic or exercise-induced anaphylaxis. 

Other Products in Pipeline:

APC-8000 (sublingual tadalafil) – The company is developing a new fast-dissolving sublingual tablet containing tadalafil (Cialis®) and intends to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with the goal of filing a New Drug Application (NDA) before year-end

APC-6000 (naloxone) – Continue to advance our naloxone product candidate for opioid overdose, and plan to file an NDA with the FDA before year-end. This is the second product using the FDA-approved injection device

APC-1000 (beclomethasone) – The FDA cleared Adamis to begin Phase 3 pivotal studies with beclomethasone metered dose inhaler and they are planning to begin patient recruitment in Q4

APC-4000 (fluticasone) – Fluticasone will be the first product candidate using patented dry powder inhaler device platform purchased from 3M. Continue to work on proof of concept studies with the objective of demonstrating proper dosing of the steroid


Anyways, our focus is on Symjepi.  The FDA a few months ago announced they accepted for review a sNDA (supplemental new drug application) for the product and that the company had fulfilled sufficient permits for a full review.  FDA stated no potential review issues identified and if no major deficiencies were identified in their continued review, target Sept 3rd as date to communicate information on proposed labeling or any post-market requirements.  


#*Timeline and Symjepi*

So, ADMP has been working with this drug around approval for the past few years.  Back in 2016 they partnered with Allergan on producing the compound, but shortly after Allergan said y'all wasting our time and terminated the licensing agreement around commercialization of Synjepi.  This really happened because the company received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) right before from the FDA.  The letter basically said that the Company has a decent product, but in order to get approval, they must expand its human factors study and reliability study which were part of the NDA filing.  These studies test the patient usability and product stress testing, which are vital.  They had to fix the studies and leave the NDA open until the issues are resolved. 

Right after Allergan bounced and they got the CRL, the company was sitting with their thumbs up their asses, so what does every good biotech company do?  BOOM.  $11 Million registered direct offering.  Fuck the shareholders.


So while they wait to fix their shit study, they are working on their pipeline and get some patents filed and resubmit their NDA for Symjepi in December of 2016, which the FDA accepts.  Some time goes by with no news, and you know what that fuckin means.  BOOM.  Public offering.  Underwritten offering of 4.28 million shares at $3.50 and half a million more in options to the underwriters who fucked the shareholders which raised about $17 million in capital.  

Two months after filing their offering and killing the shares, they hit gold.  FDA Approved their product, stock went from roughly $4 to $6 and hovered around $5.50 for a while and then went on that roller coaster ride I talked about at the beginning.  Shit looks like a heart monitor with all the spikes and drops.  Anyways, FDA approval comes for their EPINEPHRINE INJECTION, USP, 1:1000 (0.3 mg Pre-filled single dose syringe) (“PFS”) for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions (Type I) including anaphylaxis.  The FDA has also approved the PFS trade name of Symjepi.

After approval they focused on marketing the product and developing the pipeline, and were pretty quiet up until November.  November comes along, they submit prior approval supplement to FDA for a pediatric version of Symjepi.  The pediatric version, which is half the dose of the normal injection, (0.15mg) is intended to potentially treat patients weighing 33-65 pounds.  Both Symjepi products are intended to provide two single-dose syringes of epinephrine (adrenaline), which is considered the drug of choice for immediate administration in acute anaphylactic reactions to allergic reaction to foods (such as nuts), insect stings or bites, drugs and other allergens, as well as idiopathic or exercise-induced anaphylaxis.  Big market for all these fuckin kids allergic to everything now adays.  Luckily for them, the FDA accepts for review their supplemental NDA for the low dose Symjepi.  

This is what we are waiting on.  The FDA to approve the sNDA of the low dose, pediatric Symjepi injection which is half the dose of the normal product.  



#*Symjepi Study*

The company did a nice little publication that (was essentially worthless) compared their product to the leading market product for allergy, asthma, and immunolgy. Symjepi fared well when compared to the market leader in this published, peer-reviewed study.  Human factor studies are very useful to test devices in order to approximate their correct or incorrect use in real situations and in different populations.  A human factors study was conducted post-approval to compare the correct use of Symjepi compared to EpiPen in untrained adolescents.   Participants were aged 12 to 17 years old, had no familiarity with an epinephrine injector device and were not trained during the study.  There were 17 male and 17 female subjects with a mean age of 14.7 years.

The participants were randomized into two groups of 17. In the first group, participants were provided Symjep devices and asked to imagine experiencing symptoms that required an immediate injection of epinephrine.  After simulating an injection with Symjepi devices, participants were provided EpiPen devices and asked to attempt a second injection. Participants in the second group were provided EpiPen devices first, then asked to attempt a second injection with the Symjepi devices.

Among all injection attempts, there were no use errors for the Symjepi device (0/34).  All 34 participants successfully completed all steps in order to simulate an epinephrine injection with the Symjepi device.  However, a total of four errors (4/34) were observed for the EpiPen with three of four incorrectly injecting their thumb.   All four errors were considered critical use errors that could have a negative impact on the effective treatment of anaphylaxis. 

The 12% error rate for participants attempting to use EpiPen in this study was similar to the use error rate observed in another published study of untrained participants which had an 11% failure rate.  It is noteworthy to understand why untrained adolescents were used in this study.  This is the largest population of fatalities caused by anaphylaxis due to foods.  Food allergies contribute to as many as 70% of all food related deaths.  Therefore, proper use of epinephrine injection devices is of paramount importance in this age group.

Basically a pretty sweet study that shows that their product is easy as fuck to use, which is crucial for use by children and teens who are dumb as fuck.  This also backs their pediatric version of their product, because why make a product that is life saving in emergencies for kids if a kid cant even figure out how to save themselves or someone right next to them.  There is really nothing groundbreaking about this product.  Its another EpiPen, just different design and apparently easier to use.  The case I would make however, is the cost of EpiPen.  Those shits have had a monopoly on the market for way too long and are way over priced.  This company is doing a good thing by providing a low cost alternative to the product, which if you look at any mothers Facebook page, is something that is apparently needed.  


#*Commercialization and Market*

So this company has had ups and downs with the Allergen deal falling through and a struggle to get approvals completed right away.  However, since gaining FDA approval for Symjepi, they are seeing growing interest that has transitioned into partnerships.  Last month, the company entered into an exclusive distribution and commercialization agreement with a branch of Novartis (Sandoz) to commercialize Sympeji.  Under the terms of the agreement, Sandoz will obtain the United States commercial rights to Symjepi in exchange for an upfront fee and potential performance-based milestones payments.  Additionally, Adamis and Sandoz will equally share net profits, as defined in the agreement, generated from sales of Symjepi in the U.S.  As part of the agreement, Sandoz will have commercial rights to the FDA-approved Symjepi Injection 0.3mg product, as well as the Symjepi Injection 0.15mg product if approved by the FDA.  Under the agreement, Adamis will retain the right to commercialize both products in territories outside of the U.S., but has granted Sandoz the first right of negotiation for such territories.  Adamis may also continue to develop the Symject™ injection platform for additional product candidates including the previously announced naloxone product candidate being developed to treat opioid overdose.

Great fuckin news that they found a partner who can handle all the sales and marketing of the product while they continue to focus on their pipeline.  Which includes FDA approval of pediatric Symjepi which is the focus here.   Honestly, EpiPen has a .15 mg dose of their epinephrine product, so I dont see an issue coming up surrounding the approval for ADMP.  

The market for epinephrine auto-injectors is pretty fuckin big.  Based on dosage it covers 0.15mg epinephrine auto injector, 0.3mg epinephrine auto injector and 0.5mg epinephrine auto injector. Based on age it covers &lt; 6 Years, 6-12 Years and &gt; 12 Years, the market for these compounds is expected to reach $24 billion annually by 2024.  With Mylan hiking their product up so massively and scaring the consumer base while also bringing scrutiny to the biopharma space, a low cost competitor is something that the market needs desperately.  

A big kicker, EpiPens are actually in low supply across the country.  Mylan’s EpiPen and the authorized generic, two widely used allergic reaction treatments, as well as Amneal Pharmaceuticals’ generic auto-injector Adrenaclick were added to the Food and Drug Administration’s drug shortage list in May. Another manufacturer, privately held Kaleo Inc., has not reported supply interruptions.  All three companies have product available but “there may be occasional spot outages.""  Many of these shortages date back to manufacturing issues at some facilities as well as delays in third party products, causing delays and back orders in finalized epinephrine injections.  This shortage spans to reach not only the United States, but also Canada and our Red Coat friends across the pond.  

A great point to note for the company, About one in 13 children has food allergies, according to the patient advocacy group Food Allergy Research and Education. Parents say there is typically a scramble in late August to buy products that contain epinephrine, which can reverse a life-threatening allergic reaction.  Kids with allergies often need to have these products in multiple places, such as school, any after-school activities and at home, compounding the problem.  

Looking back to my earlier note on the ease of product use of Symjepi, another highlight can be drawn.  Many parents want Mylan's EpiPen due to familiarity and use. Even if competing options are available, some parents say they prefer Mylan’s products, because each product injects the epinephrine medication differently and school staff tend to have more experience with the EpiPen.  However, if you remove the need of experience with a simple, easy to use device that can be used correctly 100% of the time by children, a nurse probably wont be killing anyone by misusing ADMP's version.  

Patient familiarity is the primary reason why doctors have continued to prescribe EpiPens and not alternatives in the majority of cases.  I believe that ADMP if marketed right could take a chunk of the market share away from competitors and Mylan in all honesty.  Will they succeed?  Doubtful.  They seem to fail. A lot.


#*Conclusion and TLDR*

I think it is currently a buy.  I believe that with their recent partnership for commercialization of Symjepi, they will start pulling in pretty good revenues due to an easy to use product and partnership with powerhouse Novartis.  Novartis wont fuck up an already approved drug.  Looking at ADMP, they have a solid support around $3, and it looks like it will be spiking probably late next week in anticipation for approval of the low dose pediatric version of Symjepi.  The market needs low cost alternatives to EpiPen that is so easy to use, 100% of teenagers and kids got it right.  Moms and doctors are worried about the high, price gouging done by Mylan along with a shortage of Epinephrine injections spreading across multiple countries.  Combining those with the easy to use, low cost alternative Symjepi that is seeking approval for its low dose version which will likely get approval based on the fact the full dose is already approved and having a .15 mg dose is pretty fucking common they shouldnt fuck it up or they need to shut down, you get a pretty decent set up.  I think it is a solid entry at this point between $3.00-$3.50, see approval most likely come in 2-3 weeks, and then sell immidately after the spike.  This stock has not held gains for a while.  Spikes up then crashes down.  Right now its at a low support zone which has held through dilutions, which they just did two weeks ago.  Due to just recently diluting, they wont be diluting again if approval is granted giving you a good opportunity to buy the run up and spike without getting crushed by dilution.

#*Too Long Really Didnt Read More Than 5 Sentences*

Looks like a buy now, add more if it drops closer to $3.00, sell immediately if it pops up over $5 and upon approval.  Potential Long term hold, but I personally wouldn't invest long term because I like gambling.


Didnt go into the science much because its nothing groundbreaking, its a fuckin EpiPen.  Companies have done it, they are just making a cheap, generic version and have a solid commercialization plan with Novartis and will be profitable eventually.

Here’s my DD. I recently bought a 2019 Ford Raptor. It was very expensive, most expensive purchase of my life. It took me for-fucking-ever to get one, even after I committed. I’d show up at lots (Atlanta area) and they would have 4 or 5, but they’d all be sold (except the fucking red one, every time). I found one at an AutoNation and left to go think about it. Went back the next day, sold. Another week or so later and I saw one (gray) and I went in, talked to the guy, went to the office, returned like 30 minutes later and the thing was sold. I couldn’t believe it. So I got talked into putting a deposit down, and had to wait like 3 more weeks before it arrived. It was ridiculous, but fuck I love that thing. 

Sales manager had been with Ford forever. Says they’re basically just going to start making trucks now, which they sell a shitload of. The Ford F-150 is the number one vehicle registered to millionaires in the United States. I’m not saying Ford doesn’t suck, they do, but they’re trucks are cool and if you disagree, you’re wrong. I think if they just focus on that and the customer experience for their large and better customer base (f150 owners) they could be alright. Fuck all those other cars though, I don’t even know why they make them.

I'll keep this short (no pun intended):

Facts:

1.) Elon Musk is under SEC investigation for his tweet

2.) $TSLA IV is expanding because of all this news

There are 2 possible outcomes of this SEC investigation:

a.) Funding is actually secured. No reason for investors to buy the stock past $420 because if the deal goes through they may lose money.

b.) Funding was not secured. Stock will guarantee to go down, because it was hyped on speculation of going private. Stock will not reach $420.

Both possibilities lead to the same outcome: Whether Elon has secured funding or not the stock will not go past $420 (at least in the short term).

Either sell naked $420 calls or $420/$420+ call credit spreads until the SEC is done doing their shit.",2018-08-08 19:31:23,"['TSLA', 'TSLA']"

What I've been doing recently is paying for data from online sports books, would rather get into the vegas data, but anyways the data tells me total # of bets placed on either side vs total $USD on either side. So you can see where the ""smart money"" pro gamblers are doing. Then I keep that in mind while watching the scores, wait till i can get an in-game live line that's like twice as good as what the pros were already doing, then bet that.

I really like this strategy. Also, for huge games like Alabama vs. Clemson the first time they played in the natty, I think like this- everyone and their brother is going to bet Alabama because of their staying power, also tons of degenerate gamblers from alabama, so I think line is overvalued towards alabama and bet clemson, etc. Keeping in mind that Vegas is a business and likes to safely make money on the vig rather than take more risks

The only upside here might be benefits from reduced corporate rate and repatriation of cash effects.

0,2700,"$BAC, Bank Stress Testing, and CCAR [DD...ish]"," I've seen the CCAR mentioned a few times now and wanted to catch everyone up on what this all means 

\*\*What is it all about?:\*\* Fed determines how well a big banks are positioned to withstand a hypothetical downturn in the economy given their current balance sheet and levels of returning capital to shareholders (the more they want to return, the better their balance sheet needs to be)

Important term: CCAR (Comprehensive capital analysis and review) A test in which the fed creates a hypothetically severe downturn event and determines if the banks current/submitted plans for returning capital are allowed, i.e., can they go forward with dividend increases and share buy backs.

\*\*When:\*\* Results will be announced by June 30th (banks had to submit documentation by April 5th).

I’ve seen some people quoting June 28th but not sure where that date is coming from

\*\*Why it affects us:\*\* Bank stocks have been struggling lately and are (imho cheap, especially $BAC). In 2017 no bank’s plans were rejected except that Captial One had to submit a new plan that address Fed identified weaknesses. There was a healthy run up by most banking stocks in the days leading up to the announcement and day of. 

In 2016 (no bank’s plans were rejected) there was a decline before the results, and a strong run up after results were released.

\*\*$BAC Specifics:\*\* 

In 2017 after being approved for a dividend increase, the board announced a 60&amp;#37; increase and a $12b share repurchase. 

$BAC closed up 2.6&amp;#37; higher on 2017 before the results were announced and then added another 1.3&amp;#37; AH post results.

The increase in interest rates just yesterday saw most banks PUMPING for a brief moment before fading into the abyss.

Overall, I think we should see some upside leading up to this and \*\*\*potentially\*\*\* some money shifting from tech to financials as buy backs will signal strength in the financial sector.

This is Geron's only drug so it is essentially all or nothing. They took out a $250m shelf offering for either the continuation of phase 3 study for imetelstat with JNJ or go at it solo. They have the funds to continue.

0,2734,$AMDA can we talk? DD inside.,"Can we talk about $AMDA? Due to metal wear in medical implants causing metal poisoning, plastic parts causing bone loss and silicon nitride being biofriendly material, killing bacteria and promoting bone fusion I think it may be only a matter of time before silicon nitride catches momentum in spine joint and dental implants. Especially factoring the netflix documentary ""bleeding edge"" exposing the metal poisoning issue. Revision surgery for these complications are estimated at $10 billion a year in a $140 billion dollar medical implant market. The danger here is the reverse split and it's important to call the bottom before entry. My theory on bottom is based on a 15 million public offering recently closed. Don't really want to go into why I believe this indicates bottom as it's speculation. So i\`m only putting in enough I\`m completely safe with losing expecting to lose everything to revers splits and maintain strong hands. With the recent offering this should have a 35M  share  float so an estimated value of 17.5 million at .50 cents a share for the entire company(my maximum target buy price). The supposed brass ring of a $140 billion dollar industry. I can agree with this math, from what i've heard speculated, that this could translate into  a large profit, possibly on Buy out and share conversion. Obviously, looking at the ticker, This would require very strong hands to not get shook and I suggest minimizing risk here to a very small long bet. Seems like alot of Money invested into a solid material in initial public offering can be picked up off the trading room floor here for pennies on the dollar.

This place stays afloat as an algorithmic online marketing machine - the display ad and search bidding algorithms are good enough to drive traffic through the EQ websites, but the company has pretty much hit its ceiling in this regard...there will be no more growth, and growth is the only thing that justifies the current valuation.

Senior management and execs are terrible, the company has hit its ceiling, the IPO was an exit strategy for investors who realized how shitty this enterprise is.

0,2751,Congressional picnic postponed tomorrow. What's the play?,"After some intense DD, here's the play.

The Congressional Picnic has been cancelled AND postponed.^1
First, what is the Congressional Picnic?
&gt;The Congressional Picnic is an annual event held on the South Lawn of the White House. Members of Congress and their families are invited to spend time with the president and other White House staffers in a relaxed setting. The Picnic features carnival rides and musical performances. Each year's Picnic features a theme, such as the Wild West, Broadway, and Mardi Gras.^2

One needs to speculate on where the food for the Congressional Picnic (CP) would be purchased.  There are some Whole Foods (owned by Amazon [$AMZN]) in the area, but there is no doubt President Trump would rather starve the Democrats than concede to Lord Bezos.  Therefore, we will assume Trump ordered all groceries be purchased from Walmart ($WMT).  Additionally, there is a Walmart conveniently located near the White House that would prove useful should any food shortages arise.^3  Unfortunately, as with everything, the Congressional Picnic (CP) was priced in two years ago, leaving no opportunity for a usual play.  Luckily, something unusual happened.

Normally, expecting an event then having that event cancelled would negatively impact a corporation.  However, all the food has already been purchased and prepared, according to our friend Sarah Westwood (and apparently it smells delicious).^4  This means Walmart has already benefited from the grocery purchase and will have the opportunity to benefit again from the same event, thereby DOUBLING expected revenues!  The only issue is timing when Trump will reschedule the event.  Since it is based on an impending immigration law vote, I suggest we go LONG on this one.

**SUGGESTION** **$WMT $90 6/29 CALLS**

Another key part to a picnic is decor.  You need to patterned blanket, the wicker basket, the bear wearing a hat, etc.  Congress is way too picky to be wearing Kirkland, so there must be another partner at play here.  That's right, Congress does it in style with help from Party City ($PRTY).  They've got all the goods to keep your picnic cool.^5  This one was definitely priced in and plaid paper plates and skimpy bikini tops never go stale.  Nothing on the table is going to the moon, so we need to build our own moon shots.

**SUGGESTION** **$PRTY $16.50 1/31/20 COVERED CALLS**

Finally, and possibly most important, we need to recognize how Congress travels.  That's right, there is a minimum three SUV detail for each Congressperson arriving, and boy do those SUVs guzzle gas.  I bet that fleet was ready to ship today, and were mighty disappointed when they heard they would not be driving slowly through the streets of DC.  Those secret service men are definitely cracking donuts out back to let off steam.  You may consider this insider information, but it will be all over CNN soon anyway so just pretend you read this later.  Back to the suggestion, they guzzle gas.  I haven't done DD on oil, so go with the $XLE ETF on this one since it's the first that showed up when I Google searched ""best oil etf"".^6

**SUGGESTION** **BUY XLE AT WHATEVER PRICE IT'S AT**


Well there you have it folks, see below for the tl;dr if you're lazy.


**tl;dr** It's been priced in and you got beat out by algos already.

0,2760,Homeboy over in /r/investing with excellent DD on $UXIN (not memeing),"I've done quite a bit of work on this one yesterday and made a simple model to forecast their financials to 2022E.  Will be buying but I don't know if it will trend up like IQ.  

Was thinking of making a post but I'll just throw some random thoughts here.

48% of the UXIN's revenue now comes from facilitating auto loans and this number will only go higher because of the low auto loan penetration rate in China (16% vs. 54% in the US, per the company's F1 filing).  Auto financing is expected to grow at a crazy 46% CAGR over the next 5 years in China.  This will drive two things: 1) fees for UXIN for facilitating loans, and 2) the overall used-car market.

I'm also not sure how the market will value this company since it will not generate a positive Op Income until 2020E (for context, IQ turns positive in 2021E).  Looks like the IPO price midpoint of $11.5 is pricing the company at a 3x revenue multiple with a ~$3.5B market cap.  Assuming they sustain 100% top-line growth this year, stock can easily trade up to $18 on a 4x multiple.  If the market values it based on EV or Market Cap to GMV, then it's up to anyone's guess.  BABA, the largest online market place in the world, trades at &lt;1.0x GMV.  Newly IPO'd stocks tend to trade at 1.3-1.4x, again that implies $18+.  Since we are already in 2018, the stock should trade on a 2020E basis by early next year, 4x multiple on 2020E sale?  $40 stock. 

So basically I think it will open at $16-18 and people will chase it.  No idea how long the market can remain irrational.  It may go up to $30 in a few days or dip below IPO price after a few days, I really don't know.  

As a long-term investment?  Sure.  You're playing the exploding growth of Chinese used-cars market and increasing car ownership.  Ratio of China's used car sales to new car sales is only 0.5, signifcantly lower than that of 2.4 in the US.  China is also the world's second largest auto market after the US.  Used car transaction volume (GMV) is expected to grow at 19% CAGR over the next 5 years.  UXIN will grow at at least ~2x the market since they have the largest market share (41%).  Depending on the execution of the management, they can grow, or lose market share.  In 1Q18 they sold 165k used cars, representing 62% growth yoy.  Will this growth be sustainable?  No fucking clue.

Bull case: management executes the fuck out of it, cut marketing spending (which has been &gt;100% of revenue in the past 2 years; they are advertising all over the place during World Cup and Leonardo DiCarpio is their spokesperson), improve customer acquisition costs, expand the platform and achieve network effects (more buyers attract more sellers, who in turn attract even more buyers).  100% top-line growth in 2018, 60-70% in 2019, 40% in 2020E,  meanwhile gross margins have to improve from 66% right now to 71% by 2020E and op margins have to improve from -23% to 6%.  ALL these have to happen for the company to achieve operating profit breakeven in 2020E.  Stock should be valued at at least 4x sales, and we get a $40 stock.

Bear case:  Top-line decelerates this year to &lt;100% while marketing and operating expenses remain high.  They lose to competitors [Guazi](https://www.guazi.com/) and [RenrenChe](https://www.renrenche.com/).  Op profit breakeven is not in sight until 2021E and beyond.  Stock re-rates to a shitty 2x revenue multiple, $12-13 stock in a year, basically flat for the next year.  We are not gonna buy it at the IPO price, say we get in at $17, that'll be a -23% loss.

So in a nutshell, the risk/reward is still pretty attractive at +100% upside/-25% downside (4:1).  I'll buy it. https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/8sjgeo/uxin_ipo_anybody_else_hear_about_this_and_have/e0zxm4u",2018-06-20 12:58:31,['UXIN']

0,2779,Why I am short $JD in the short-term (quick DD inside).,"Disclaimer: I am Chinese and lived in China for 16 years. I have been a huge $JD bull in the past, but right now I am short.

2 reasons I am short $JD in the short-term, TLDR at the end.

1. Take a look at the 1-year chart. $JD stock had a huge run up in July and August of 2017, partially due to the huge success of 6/18 holiday. Recall the Q2 2017 ER in August though, stock dropped $48 to $40. If my memory is correct, this is due to huge marketing and promotion costs related to the 6/18 holiday. Lots of discounts and advertising to attract customers, plus intense competition from $BABA. $JD ended up reporting a negative EPS. 

This year, $JD has further ramped up its marketing and promotion. Lots of advertising on Chinese social media websites, which were NOT seen in 2017. Additionally, I have heard complaints from my Chinese friends and relatives that this year JD has dropped the discount level on the goods. Some of them are spending more money on Tmall ($BABA essentially). This is getting into subjective territory, so I will stop here.

2. Recall Q4 2017 ER in March 2018. Huge revenue growth and customer accounts growth, but stock dropped like a rock. Fundamental reason? Profit margin is around 0%. The stock market cares about returns on investments. People want to see positive earnings. I personally think the top line growth should mitigate some of the bad bottom line numbers, but as I learned the hard way, don't bet against the market.

Additionally, management has stated on the ER that they are still investing, in logistics and infrastructures. This is generally bad news for short-term run, and impatient investors are not happy. Again, see the drop in March 2018.

TLDR: High marketing costs and lack of profits will hurt short-term results. In order for $JD to truly breakout, the company need to start reporting positive profits, and improving profits. If you plan to hold this stock for 5+ years you should be fine.",2018-06-18 13:36:43,"['JD', 'JD', 'JD', 'JD', 'BABA', 'JD', 'JD', 'BABA', 'JD']"

Despite its triple digit revenue growth, investors were less than enamored with Uxin's (UXIN) IPO as the deal not only priced well below expectations, but, the company was also forced to slash the size of the deal. With Chinese stocks getting hammered recently - the Shanghai Composite is officially in a bear market now - UXIN was facing a major headwind in terms of negative sentiment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main concern is that an escalating and prolonged trade war could have a material impact on the Chinese economy, which would hurt an economically-sensitive business like car sales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for the IPO, UXIN cut the deal size to 25 million ADS (each ADS represents 3 ordinary shares) from 38.0 million, with the IPO pricing at $9 versus the $10.50-$12.50 expected price range. In all, the deal raised $225 million in gross proceeds, almost 50% less than it had anticipated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lead underwriters on the deal were JP Morgan, Cowen, Leerink Partners, and BMO Capital. Shares are set to open for trading later this morning on the Nasdaq.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overview&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UXIN is the largest used car e-commerce platform in China. Uxin makes it possible for consumers to buy cars from dealers, and for dealers to buy cars from other dealers and consumers, through an online and offline platform. The company says it has transformed used car commerce in China. Its platform allows sellers to reach a broad audience and ensures that users have access to an extensive nationwide selection of used cars. Its offline infrastructure allows Uxin to provide services such as inspection, title transfer and delivery of vehicles etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its platform consists of: 1) Uxin Used Car, its 2C business catering to consumer buyers. It provides consumers with customized car recommendations, financing, title transfer, delivery, insurance referral, warranty and other related services; and 2) Uxin Auction, its 2B business catering to business buyers. It helps businesses source vehicles, optimize their turnover and facilitate cross-regional transactions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uxin currently has a nationwide network of over 670 service centers across more than 270 cities that provides services at each step of the transaction cycle.

Apple stated they planned to get rid of their “Touch ID” option in their newer phones. This benefits Lumentum a lot, mainly because their involved with the face recognition feature on the iPhone, which deals with 3D sensing. I don’t know how the market will react to it, but it would be a better play for long calls. Phones that use face recognition are supposed to double in the next two years, mainly because many androids haven’t added the feature yet.

Partly due to you folks, and the mismanagement by a shallremainunnamed firm trashing my IRA by 30% in a year, I did what every red blooded idiot would do, and cashed in my IRA, took my funds, and opened a robinhood account.

I started this week. I bought $NLST on a whim at .12 on a feeling it'll go up within a few weeks, and forgot to set a sell order for .20... saw it was over yesterday and thought I lost out, until I realized, I still had it.

Yesterday I bought 9 $V 140 8/17 calls for $2.30 a pop, when the underlying stock was about $134.90. Thought it was a decent entry point (prob coulda waited another hour or so and the option price would have been around $2.10, but I digress). 

Watching V rally today, and it went from my $134.90 price of entry, up to $135.51, however the option price only bumped up 3 cents to $2.33. What the fuck? I get that the delta is low, but it seems that the negative price movement is almost exponential to the positive. Here are the stats on the contracts:

V $140 8/17 Call
Delta: 0.3539
Theta: -0.0352


What gives? Am I missing something obvious? How did the stock rally 60 cents from my entry price yesterday afternoon, and managed to move the contracts three fucking cents?

With an announcement of debt reduction, along with a big ER, SP could skyrocket.

DD: They made $9.23B in the last year with $1.1B in earnings. They've destroyed earnings each of the last 2 quarters, and last quarter had earnings of 34 cents a share, on a $4 stock. What's up with that? The only thing keeping this share price down is the amount of debt. Any progress on that end could send it much higher, and the CEO has said that the common shareholder would be rewarded this year.

Then a streak of bad news/events came.  Restasis (~9% of sales) patent suit loss, Esmya (supposed blockbuster pipeline drug pending FDA approval) liver toxicity cases in EU, Botox-competitor drug announced by RVNC, etc etc.

**FORECAST**

N/A -- this week is light AF on economic reports that might actually matter.

**WHAT TO EXPECT**

Predicted: Green

Results: Red

My record, so far: 11/21 (52.38% -- down from 55%)

No. Fuck you, $SPY. Clean yourself up and get your shit together.

**ANYTHING ELSE?**

[Ref. forecast for 5/7/18 - 5/11/18](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8h9ve8/us_economic_results_5718_51118/)

Let's go over the results for yesterday:

**FORECAST**

**PPI (MoM) (Apr)**

**Predicted:** 0.3

**Actual:** 0.1

They changed the forecast again (from 0.3 to 0.2). Motherfuckers need to quit doing that.

**WHAT TO EXPECT**

Predicted: RED

Results: GREENER THAN GANGRENOUS GONADS

My record, so far: 10/18 (55.56% -- down from 58.82%)

It's probably safe to say that I completely misread this week, and I think I know what I did wrong: I didn't let the prediction model dictate my guesses the way I should have. I think I either overthought it or got emotional (or both). Am I losing my autistic touch?

**ANY REVISIONS?**

Can't revise -- missed the midnight deadline because I spent all night in the hospital with my $SPY puts. I had to pull the plug on 3 of them (the $263-$265 strike contracts), since I was down over 50%, and wanted to pick up some $TSLA calls (which recovered about 80% of the hole my $SPY puts left in my heart).

0,3043,High yield dividend strategy with zero price risk? Can someone explain how this isn’t riskless free money?,"Step 1: find a high yield dividend paying stock, e.g. Centurylink. $CTL costs $18.50/share and pays quarterly dividend of $0.54/share for an annualized yield of 12%.

Step 2: Buy 100 shares about one month prior to ex dividend date (let’s say we buy tomorrow and the stock goes ex dividend 6/4/18). Debit = $1,850.

Step 3: Sell one ATM call and buy one ATM put (i.e. $18.5 strikes) expiring shortly after going ex dividend (e.g. 6/8/18). You are now completely price-risk neutral and the option prices should offset at $100 each. Net debit = $0.

Step 4: Collect your $52 dividend and sell your stock. One month prior to the next dividend date, repeat step one. You have now locked in a 12% annualized yield with virtually no price risk.

Maximum profit on this trade = X*c* - S*t* + c - p + D = $18.5 - $18.5 + $1.0 - $1.0 + $0.54 = $0.54 (x 100 = $54)

Maximum loss = S*t* - X*p* + c - p + D = $18.5 - $18.5 + $1.0 - $1.0 + $0.54 = $0.54 (x 100 = $54)

I know what you’re thinking: why go through all this trouble for a measly $54 dollars. Well, repeat that process 3 more times and you’ve made $216 for the year. Or do it instead with 500 shares and then you’ve made $1,080 for the year. And so on.

Spotify is eating them alive. Its a zero sum game, you're not listening to Spotify and Pandora. Either you're on Apple music or one of these platforms. 

Pandora had 5.63m paying subscribers as of last Q. Spotify ADDED 8 million and now has 83 million paying customers. And those added customers didn't come from nowhere. Some definitely migrated from Pandora. 

Spotify's costs went up significantly this Q, but luckily they're still in the honeymoon period of existence where investors will still give them room to grow and blow through cash. Pandora's expenses must have gone up too and they are definitely not going to be given the same grace as $SPOT. 

Pandora's has a fucking [26% short interest.](http://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=P&amp;submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2).

- ""The decline (in listener hours) 
 that Pandora saw last year is reversible"". They planned on spending more money this Q on marketing to 'fix' this, as if marketing is the problem here. Everyone knows about you, you're just inferior. 

[They bought Adswizz this this quarter](https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/29/pandoras-acquisition-of-audio-adtech-company-adswizz-is-complete/) and the big question this Q is, was it worth it?

Cat food and pet medicine stock. Thanks to a massive oversupply of liberal arts degrees,  careerism trends, and feminist propaganda, 1-800-PetMeds ($PETS) has  seen booming growth in sales over the past year. In North America, young  adults are 8 times as likely to own a pet than a child, and pets are  now twice as likely to be vaccinated as children.

The  $30.6 billion U.S. pet food market is expected to grow 5.4% a year over  the next five years, but more importantly, the proliferation of  internet pornography continues to drive down marriage rates, and by  implication, drive up pet ($PETS) ownership rates, especially among  women.

$PETS uses an online model similar  to Amazon to disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar retailers and uses an  omni-channel approach to support rapid growth. Revenues are growing 13%  yoy and growth continues to be supported by unusually high prices on  prescription products.

The rising  standards of living for humans will trickle down to pets, and humans  will continue to spend more on pet health compared to how much we spend  on our own health. Long $PETS

Now at 10k a car and say they produce 10,000 a week(which is also ludicrous Tesla’s demand is way less than 520,000 cars a year over the next 2-3 years analysts peg about 320,000 orders currently having lost 24% of orders net YoY).

That’s 5.2 Billion in EBITDA roughly using favorable terms (10k profit/car, producing and having enough demand for 10,000 cars a week) while still having terrible cash flow due to all the debt. Now we have to assign a multiple to the EBITDA: GM trades at ~3x EBITDA, FIAT at 2.5x, Ford ~2.2x, Toyota at 9x EBITDA, Nissan at ~2x, Volkswagen at 1.5x, Mercedes at 2.2x. As can been seen it’s a very low multiples industry. Let’s assume it trades at 9x like Toyota to give it a high end that’s a share price of 217 on the high end after accounting for debt value, more in line with the rest of the industry other than Toyota; if it trades at a low 3x in line with the rest of the industry it’s worth about 50 bucks.

In two days it will be the 25th of July. Why is that date important, you may ask? PayPal. Earnings. ""Okay okay u/Sparkswont, PayPal reports their EPS on Wednesday, but why do I give a shit?""

Venmo. In 2013, PayPal whipped their dick out and made one of the best purchases in the history of the company. For the cheap price of $800 million, PayPal acquired Venmo. Since then, Venmo has exponentially increased the amount of cash they process on a quarterly basis. Since I know most of you faggots can barely read, I've put together a visual for you:

https://i.imgur.com/LFHl4Jg.png

As we all know, money isn't paper anymore, it's all 1s and 0s in a database. Only old man Buffet uses tangible money these days, the real money is in the arbitrary ""balances"" in all these fucking mobile cash apps. Trust me, the last time any of my friends paid me in cash was the stone age. It's always through Venmo.

""Okay sparkyboy, you're starting to make sense. But so what if Venmo is doing billions in transactions? They don't even monetize it.""

Wrong. Venmo takes 3% in fees for every credit card transaction. PayPal is raking in this free cash all because kids these days don't care that 3% of their fucking money is disappearing under their nose.

Now, all that is well and good, but let's look at some historical charts. PayPal is likely to report positive EPS, but we all know that doesn't mean shit (see $NFLX). Let's take a look at how $PYPL has reacted to earnings beats in the past.

&amp;nbsp;

Date|EPS Forecast|Actual EPS|Stock Movement
:--|:--|:--|:--
04/25/2018|0.41|0.45|+4.05%
01/31/2018|0.38|0.4|-5.88%
10/19/2017|0.32|0.34|+9.09%
07/26/2017|0.33|0.36|+5.17%

&amp;nbsp;

Of the last 4 ERs, $PYPL has rallied on 3 of them. Fuck me, that's some good odds. Clearly there was a bit of a sell off in January, but it's probably just because of how extra monotone Daniel Schulman's (CEO) voice was sounding that day on the earnings call (trust me, I just listened to it and nearly fell asleep). Maybe people passed out and their head accidentally landed on the sell button, who knows.

Anyways, there's a lot more DD I could do on this, but by now you're already buying $ROPE because of your $MU FDs, so all you need to know is **I am your hail mary.**

All of you beautiful minds talked him out of it saying ""leverage decay"" and ""you'll lose everything if QQQ dips 33%."" Both of those statements are false, and I'm going to show you why but I also have a few questions for those of you who have savant syndrome.

FIRST: ""Leverage decay will eat away any gains"" This is true for volatile things like JNUG and DGAZ, but we all know the indices tend to be more bullish than bearish in the very long term. This is actually BENEFICIAL for 3x leveraged index etfs. (see the difference in % gains in 5 years of UDOW vs ^ DJI or TQQQ vs QQQ) In a bullish market, the leveraged ETFs actually make more than just 3x as much due to the compounding percentages of multiple green days.

Here is why I believe 3x leveraged ETFs are good long term: take the Dow over the last 40 years.. a ~2786% gain. That's roughly an average of 8.67% a year (1.0867 ^ 40x100=~2786%) There are 252 trade days in year, so the average daily percent gain is 0.00033% (1.00033 ^ 252=8.67% = average year gain) So something like UDOW would get 0.00099% average gains everyday (because it makes 3 times as much adjusted everyday) Over a year that would equal ~28.32% (notice how it's higher than 8.67% x 3) This compounding year over year on something like 10k for 40 years would equal ~$214 Million (10,000 x 1.2832 ^ 40). The math, I think, checks out but this can't be the case, right? Otherwise we'd all be millionaires by the time we retire. The oldest leveraged ETF I can find is only 12 years old, so it's hard to tell exactly how they would work in a 40 year term. Any one of you savants know?

Also, a 33% drop in the un-leveraged underlying would not equal a 99% drop in the leveraged ETF. See the &gt;55% drop from peak to trough in the S&amp;P from 2007 to 2009 vs. the only ~85% drop in its 2x leveraged ETF $SSO",2018-05-08 21:02:48,['SSO']

I'm pretty new to options plays and WSB in general. I started out with a +$20,000 profit on a $25,000 account balance on RH in two semi-YOLO plays. (The first one's are free)

Almost immediately lost it all (including my initial balance) to $MU and FOMO'ing $TLRY. Truly, the money was funds that I can afford to lose, and the dollar amount is not going to make a tangible difference in my life.

HOWEVER - I noticed that when I got lucky on my winners, I felt like I was on top of the world. No one could say shit to me, I'm killing it. It was a good feeling.

Inversely is something that I just realized. I caught a malaise around the end of September that's lasted through now, with our Red October. I haven't been working out as hard, working @ my day job as productively, been lazy around the house, etc. I didn't even realize how unproductive and useless I've been until today (three weeks later). It seems to have stemmed from my major option losses.

My Q is: Psychologically, you guys notice a difference in your day-to-day behavior (not necessarily mood swings, but just overall drive) as well? Anyone else caught this malaise?

**Sector is down, except for CavCo**  
Residential construction, this quarter, [has been down](https://imgur.com/p0JBobo). Only three companies, $AVHI, $CVCO, and $CHCI are up YTD. $CHCI is only a $10M company with very little information available. $AVHI is likely to be acquired by a larger company, spiking its price. $CVCO is a **tank** with a P/E of 35, while the rest of the sector sits below 16. They are the exception to the rule.  
Every other company is struggling, ranging from -5% to -56% YTD, with $KBH at -20%.

**KBH up vs. this time last year**  
KBH is still up 22% from this time last year. Meaning- there's still room to fall. In fact, from 2014 until 2017 they very rarely [got above $20](https://imgur.com/4bBl5yb).  
I think they struggled to sell houses this quarter.

Some believe that KBH will get in on rebuilding after the Hurricane, but their resources are heavily invested in the West Coast. I think guidance will lower when the West Coast backlog grows going into Q4, and then the annual report will bring them back to a reasonable valuation.

0,3214,"My take on $PLUG power, near and long term tendies, DD inside","**TLDR**: Buy $PLUG $3 11/16 calls for tendies as Plug Power will see the results of opening new factory, developing robots to take advantage of autonomous forklifts and delivery trucks, and developing new tech to double power storage. $AMZN, $NKE, and $WMT already use their equipment (and will purchase more) and $FDX has conducted 7500mi of deliveries in the Albany area using a Plug Power powered FedEx truck.

&amp;#x200B;

**DD**:

WSB listen up - Plug power is going to pop soon with a price target of $3.57, a 90% increase over its current price for the near term tendies. It will increase over the next quarter further as it completes its transition from research company to viable manufacturing company. I have 155 $3 11/16 calls for the near term tendies based around its 11/8 earning report, which I'll then turn over to 3/15 calls for the long term tendies where I expect it will jump yet further.

Walmart, Amazon, Nike, and FedEx have opened contracts with Plug Power for hydrogen powered forklifts and vehicles. Hydrogen power might seem lame but their niche is in industrial forklifts and local deliveries where time spent recharging is thousands of dollars a minute. Their CEO Andy Marsh has also been named to the U.S. Department of Energy Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technical Advisory Committee, giving the business the political connections it needs to succeed. Jonathan Silver, a member of the board of directors, is also a former US Department of Energy official. They are also pursuing European expansion to become an international company, where the political connections will offer them an advantage over their competitor Bloom Energy.

All eight of the board members have purchased hundreds of thousands of shares in the company four times since the beginning of the year, most recently in late August, signalling that they see a positive future for the company as it has turned around from a research company to a viable industrial and manufacturing business. Institutional investors have increased their stakes by millions of shares - Odey Asset Management Group Ltd bough an additional 2,330,000 shares increasing their stake in the company to 4,910,000 shares. Ignore the misleading title of the article and read content for a breakdown of the institutional investor increases: ([https://www.fairfieldcurrent.com/2018/09/23/insider-selling-plug-power-inc-nasdaqplug-director-sells-31343-shares-of-stock.html](https://www.fairfieldcurrent.com/2018/09/23/insider-selling-plug-power-inc-nasdaqplug-director-sells-31343-shares-of-stock.html))

This is also different than a vehicle running on LPG or other alternative fuel. The hydrogen isn't burned in the traditional sense, but is instead run through a membrane that strips the electrons from hydrogen using a catalyst and generates electricity directly from the reaction - the hydrogen then bonds with available oxygen and generates water as a byproduct. The advantage of this type of system is the reduced refueling/recharging time compared to traditional electric forklifts that are used in warehouses, and the reduced emissions compared to traditionally powered forklifts. Their systems are retrofit-capable and can be fitted to currently owned electric forklifts, reducing the overhead of purchasing all-new equipment.

They have also in-sourced the production of the membrane electrode assemblies to further reduce costs ([https://www.gasworld.com/interview-with-plug-power-ceo/2015463.article](https://www.gasworld.com/interview-with-plug-power-ceo/2015463.article)) and opened a new almost 40k SQFT factory in Rochester New York ([https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/08/15/plug-power-adds-factory-in-clifton-park](https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/08/15/plug-power-adds-factory-in-clifton-park)). They used to purchase their membranes for their equipment from their competitor Bloom Energy, and now that they are producing their own membranes they have announced two new pieces of technology - a new membrane that doubles the energy output of its fuel cell system. They have also partnered with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the US DOE to develop a robotic fueling station and reduces the time needed to refuel and allows the the usage of autonomous warehouse equipment powered by its system.

0,3233,Why I think you should be playing $GERN this week [DD],"Hi everyone,

Many of you are familiar with Geron and the upcoming announcement regarding Janssen (J&amp;J) and their decision to continue in their collaboration.

The Terms:

Stated on Geron's website, if the decision is made to continue, then Geron would receive $65 million in payments initially, with up to $470 million in payments for reaching other milestones along the way. Assuming the continuation decision is made and Geron decides to opt-in to further advance development with Janssen, then the market cap of the stock would immediately rise to 1.6B from the current 1.14B market cap. This would put share price at about $8.90 on the high end. This is about a 43% increase, and that is assuming the share price only reflects the companies' cash value.

Will imetelstat be successful?

Currently, Janssen has an open recruitment for a Phase 2/3 trial of the drug. Previously, Geron and Janssen have completed multiple clinical trials on the product, but the results are not posted to the public. This usually occurs when further research is being done on the drug, and is not necessarily a good nor a bad sign. 

Why is this drug so awesome though? Because of telomeres.
The shortening of telomeres has been a huge problem that pharmaceutical companies have been jumping on in recent times. Essentially, as our DNA replicates over and over again as we age, the protective caps on the end, known as telomeres, shorten over time. As they get shorter, we become more susceptible to the effects of aging, including an increased risk of cancer. With telomere research being hot right now, proof of the efficacy of a drug that directly works on telomerase will pave way for tons of new research in the area. From being a part of the pharmaceutical industry (although I don't work in the science part of it), I hear all the companies talking about how important telomere research is, and how controlling telomerase is one of the steps to preventing or controlling cancer. Janssen knows this, and even though imetelstat might not be used for diseases outside of the current clinical trials (breast cancer, myelodysplastic syndromes), the knowledge that the approval of the drug brings is essential to the development of future drugs.

Sources:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5796239/
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01242930?term=imetelstat&amp;rank=5

Geron is basically a one-drug company. If the deal falls through, the stock is going to the earth's core. Because of this, I'm being a bit more cautious in this play. I'm expecting a large run-up before the announcement this week (It has to happen before the 30th of this month). I'm expecting a Thursday announcement but I'm only basing that on the fact that JnJ has previously announced continuations on Thursdays, but that really means nothing because they've done it on Mondays and Saturdays before. 

The CEO of Geron, John Scarlett, has previously led biopharm companies to acquisitions. He has years of experience and knows that if this fails, the company will have to cease operations.

I know most of you guys aren't going to read all of this anyway so if you have any questions about my reasoning let me know.

I currently own shares of the stock and plan to sell them on the run-up this week, where I will then open a bullish strap strangle ATM , as I prefer safer plays on biotech stocks like these.

May your tendies be plenty and your RH account green.

0,3244,[OC] [Analysis] Down on your luck? Sick of tech stocks? Let $LONE &amp; $BCC be your saving grace,"Below you will find an of $LONE &amp; $BCC stock &amp; why you should invest prior to market closing today in preparation for market open on Monday, August 6th. After August 6th, $LONE should be sold shortly after with $BCC having a slightly longer hold period. 

$LONE as of August 3rd, 2:02 PM sits at $9.11 a share.
$BCC as of August 3rd, 2:02 PM sits at $43.50 a share. 

Let's get started.

**Lonestar Resources ($LONE) will beat earnings expectations in the short term massively, leading to an overbuy than dip. Avoid the dip.**

1. With current moves in the oil market, they are expected to come out way ahead. **Production in the last quarter jumped 48%** year-over-year to 7,777 Boe'd (Barrels of Oil Equivalent per Day). At the end of the year, metrics are anticipated to reach an incredibly phenomenal rate of ~10,500.

2. EBITDA (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) is expected to rise from $110 -&gt; $125 million based on guidance metrics. 

3. Lonestar has initiated a new program for production expansion from the start of the year. In November, stock was trading at $3-4 a share, towards January, $5.50. Now in July, an incredible $8.91 a share. Although fast, there doesn't seem to be any slowing down with this company with the trend.

4. Loanstar took out a massive loan of $250 million to increase its production and expansion. You may be thinking that companies taking massive loans are bad, but in turn they count towards current assets / cash on hand instead of a liability in the short term. It is not set to retire for another full year. 

5. Long term, Lonestar is a no-go. Short term, it's perfect. Currently Lonestar is slightly overbought and will expect a downward correction if the RSI continues to rise. It's going to rise with the upcoming earnings. 

**Boise Cascade Company ($BCC) is a lumber company and we all love good wood. It has sustained through the wood shortage last year and gained massive momentum through the entire year.** 

1. Has grown ~50% in the past year. Year to date performance of 6.77%. In the past three months, a small but generous gain of 2.53% in price change. 

2. Current **P/E ratio is sitting at 16.41** Forward P/E 13.27, and PEG 2.52. 

3. Summer is nearing its end and fall is right around the corner. Wood production &amp; purchases are notorious to rise towards this time. Currently, the company has a $456m of debt but has sustained it in the recent year. It has short term assets to cover the debt priced to be roughly $170m, which in turn shows a **debt coverage rate of 37%.** 

4. Zacks Equity Research has placed $BCC as a strong buy with its current ratio valuations compared to market competitors. The stock, according to Zacks, is undervalued (Current trade price is 43.45) where it stands and should be trading towards $53 with its price target. Expect upcoming earnings to shoot shares upwards to above $53 then correct itself. 

Hope you guys enjoyed this write up.

Some Stifel jagoff reminded everyone to be scared of a Teva generic for Corcept's drug Korlym, essentially their only profit source, but that was May 31st and the downtrend started on June 15th. And Corcept has protection from a Teva ANDA being filed until October 2020 cause of the 30-month stay rule. 

By the time a generic comes out, just about every analyst who knows his shit and eats his tendies says Corcept's other drug Relacorilant will take over Korlym's market space. Korlym is the same compound as the RU-486 abortion pill so it messes with strange and whatnot. Relacorilant is about to be in phase 3, has had results thus far that have outperformed Korlym, and doesn't make chicks shit kids. So even if Teva isn't chapter seven elevening by 2020 and spits out a generic Korlym, they're not taking any market space. 

Here's some earnings highlights boys

* Revenues have grown at a CAGR of 117% in the past 5 years
* Earnings have grown for seven straight quarters
* Current FY2018 revenue guidance of $275-300 million implies revenue growth of almost 100% YoY
* Completely debt free
* 101% ROE, 86% ROA, 85% ROI
* Shares getting bought back slowly
* SH equity quadrupled last year
* Teva is down 82% since buying that generic shitshow Actavis in '15

Add to all of this the fact that the FDA estimated Korlym has an addressable market size five times bigger than its current market share.

In addition to this, some of the projects have huge business cycle lengths that don't allow profits to be seen for a while. However, in last quarters earnings it was stated that there were a number of big players who had contracted with AAOI, and that investors would start to see the gains from that and from previous partners. This is really important for guidance and you will see why later. 

\&amp;nsbp;  

What is really important is the data center aspect. Revenue growth from that has been extreme in china and taiwan over the last couple of years. This contrasts with a majority of CAT5 projects they used to do which have very long business cycles, the data center projects they have are way faster in the time to completion which in turn leads to more profits in the short term. Also, a proxy company that handles almost everything for AAOI outside of the US just recently filed with the SEC that they were taking on a loan from a Taiwanese bank. My guess is they will be using that to finance projects there because AAOI doesn't really have a huge debt/equity ratio currently. Plus it would be good to see on QE report that production was ongoing in Taiwan and china regardless of trade talks.  

\&amp;nbsp;  

Here's the play. AAOI for reasons unknown has a fucking massive short interest ratio, 61.49% last reported. I tried to look into it as some sort of convertible bond play, but that only accounted for like a 1.5 to 3% short interest ratio. I'm guessing it has just been labeled as a consensus short. In addition to this, 70% of AAOI is industry owned, which leads me to believe this a little more. As we talked about earlier, AAOI has great long term growth outlook, so at some point all of these shorts will have to cover because AAOI should be getting better valuations through 2018-19(especially Q42018 Q12019) that will drive the stock price higher. But for all we know this earnings could very well be the catalyst for a short squeeze of Enron Musk proportions.  

\&amp;nbsp;  

But if their earnings goes to shit the short sentiment will be regarded as true and the stock will tank. That is why I don't recommend doing anything until you see what happens after hours. Also the premiums on these options are ridiculous so a poor fag like myself will probably just stick to the stocks so I can still profit if a short squeeze happens. Here's hoping to The Big Squeeze ya filthy animals.  Also to all the other poor fags that use RH you have no excuse not to check this since RH allows free after hours trading now.

There has been no doubt for quite a while the drug lowers cholesterol by roughly 20% compared to placebo, but investors have been awaiting new data on safety after May's trial result showing the experimental drug-arm with a higher proportion of fatalities (albeit p-value=0.11).

Today's results on fatalities show:

&gt;Fatal adverse events with 1.1 percent \[in bempedoic acid\] and 0.8 percent \[in placebo\], respectively. No fatal adverse events were determined to be related to study medication.  CV deaths were balanced between the study arms (0.8% vs. 0.8%). The bempedoic acid arm included a case of gas poisoning and a case of sepsis as a complication of planned abdominal surgery. 

My best guess is the p-value of this fatality difference is approximately 0.7; however, the experimental drug arm once again trended toward higher fatalities than placebo (certainly gives me pause, and will to the FDA).

0,3281,Long Straddles to profit from IV run up pre-earnings,"Alright so first of all, I want to make sure everyone understands I'm asking about buying long straddles **WEEKS** from earnings not the night before. I've seen too many posts where people buy a FD straddle the day before earnings at the peak of IV only to wonder why they lost money ""when the move in the underlying was significant"". 

**Long Straddle and IV**

So now my actual question

IV typically has a huge run up prior to earnings, and a huge drop after the reports are released.

1. Is it possible to take advantage of the IV run up by buying a long  straddle far out from earnings? For example, let's say I purchase a straddle for $AMD strike price 32 exp Oct 26. Earnings report for AMD is apparently October 24. I would sell the day before earnings to take advantage of IV run up.

**OR**

1. Is it too late to purchase a long straddle now?
2. Would it be safer to buy options with further expiration and could further expiration affect IV run up and Vega?

**Risks**

I  know there can be a huge risk of time decay, but I'd imagine the profit  from Vega and increased IV would counteract this? Another way you can  make money from long straddles is hoping for a sharp move in the  underlying, increasing extrinsic value exceeding the cost of the premium, but typically, the move isn't significant enough to counteract the money lost from IV crush and time decay.

**Conclusion**

If  you guys do plays using long straddles, either holding through earnings (not FDs) or selling to profit from IV, let me know what you guys think.

Also feel free to tell me my line of thinking is wrong.

Thanks

Plus, cord cutting is accelerating more than expected. The entire media networks segment (largest and most profitable biz unit) is going to miss forecasts. The time to buy will be when cord cutting plateaus (no indication of that coming soon).

0,3295,IQ Strategy,"Ok, first things first:

A trade war should have no relevancy on the growth of iQiyi. This company does not deal with the US in any way, shape or form. IQ dropping on trade war fears is pure market irrationality. Was NFLX being impacted, at all, by the trade war? No. It plummeted because of a less than stellar subscriber growth number. Speaking of which...

iQiyi is a goddamn monster. 67 million subscribers, and around half a billion monthly users. Their top priority is to convert those users into subscribers - paid or unpaid, and if you look at their subscriber growth figures, it is working - they gained around 20 million subscribers since Q1. Currently, IQ is the 27th most popular website in China (180th worldwide). They are already big - and they are growing rapidly. 

I actually went through the mentally traumatizing experience of listening to the Q2 earnings call and attempting to understand it. To essentially summarize it:

Subscriber count will continue to grow very fast.

Revenue is NOT their primary goal. At this current stage, they want to expand membership as fast as possible. 

\-IQ is expanding licensing agreements to domestic TV channels, this will apparently help with their content awareness/brand awareness.

\-Skymoons (a game development company that IQ acquired) already has products online,

\-IQ sales promotions don't have ""significant impacts"" on final membership numbers. However, they help IQiyi gain insights into what the users want (basically its data mining) and thus help them gain in the long run.

\-IQ is apparently in compliance with some regulation regarding show compensation. IQiyi is in talks with the Chinese government regarding content costs.

\-IQiyi is incubating in-house production. IQ's 2nd quarter in-house production of content was a ""historical high"" and they have been investing heavily towards making their own shows. 

IQ is basically doing three big things:

1. Growth in membership
2. Vertical integration by making their own content.
3. Horizontal integration of the entertainment space (see Skymoons acquisition)

And they will not face any opposition from the government. NFLX will never go to China, and nothing in China will be able to stand up to IQ. In fact, iQiyi doesn't want to be only a media company. They are aiming for total domination of the Chinese entertainment business. They want video games, licensed TV productions, and they are probably going to open their own fucking gong theme park.  They are going to dominate the Chinese entertainment space because nobody will stop them. They are going to grow even faster, because the Chinese middle class wants these things in order to live a middle class lifestyle. 

I would recommend against iQiyi options, for the simple reason that the market is being irrational about the trade war. But IQ shares? Tie them to your MU with a $ROPE so they both go to fucking Alpha Centauri. ",2018-08-03 21:35:51,['ROPE']

0,3338,Shotspotter ($SSTI) DD,"Full disclosure: I have a long position in this stock at an average cos of 51.37. This stock as near it's 52 week high, so if you are not a long buyer, be weary of a pullback. Please do your own DD.

Just wanted to present some information about a stock that i've been following for a few weeks now. It's still pretty under the radar with low volume.

SSTI is a company that produces detectors that detect gun fire and informs police of the location through triangulation in as little as 30 seconds. Apparently, this is useful, because in areas of high gun violence, people tend to become desensitized to it and police often don't get called.

The first question I had was, how can this tech discriminate between a gun shot and something similar sounding, like a firework. So, I learned that the captured sounds are routed to their headquarters where they have an experienced team that listens to the sounds and helps distinguish between a gun shot and other similar sounding sounds.

So, they are able to detect the gun shots, does this actually make a difference? I found a lot of firsthand anecdotal evidence from people that lived in cities that have this tech present. Some people said it worked and police were able to get evidence much more quickly, while others said police showed up, and even though it happened quickly, it still didn't make a difference as they couldn't find shell casings and the perpetrators had already fled. However, recently, the city of Chicago renewed shotspotter to a 3 year/23 million dollar contract, and stated that it helped lower gun violence by a 43% total. The Chicago police superintendent even said that this technology was the biggest fact in reducing gun violence and that it was a game changer. This figure still seems unbelievable to me, but honestly it doesn't even matter. The fact of the matter is is that gun violence is not gonna decrease anytime soon. They are never going to institute any gun control measures. But, as these events become more and more publicized, governments and police forces are going to need to look like they're trying to combat the problem, and this is the exact type of tech they're going to spend money on to at least make it seem like they care. The contract extension does give me belief that the product is legit though.

With this in mind, there is a lot of room for expansion. They are in about 90ish cities right now with plans to expand to 140+ in the coming year. So how are they expanding? Previously, they had a partnership with Verizon to be packaged in security suite of products that Verizon would advertise through their brand. Recently, Verizon decided to allow Shotspotter to be sold as a stand alone product. Why does this matter? Previously, if people didn't want to buy the entire suite, they didn't have the option to buy shotspotter alone, but now they can and that should increase sales. There can also be expansion that occurs within the cities they are already located in. For example, after initial testing, Chicago decided to expand Shotspotter into a bigger area, which obviously means more revenue for SSTI.

So, there is a lot of room for growth imo. In terms of financials, the stock is near its 52 week high. I hesitated to post this now, because I know people tend to see hype on a stock and then jump in, but there is a possibility this could see a short term pullback, so please do your own DD. If you are long though, I think any time is a good time to get in. The market cap is only at 650Million, and if we extrapolate the chicago contract out to other cities, it becomes obvious that there is a lot of room for growth. The company increased 52% in revenue from Q1 to Q2 and they were on the cusp of being profitable. Again, please do your own DD and feel free to as any questions

0,3341,$57k Yolo Twitter buy based on the Washington Post report. Likely that their report that active user will decline isn't factual based on how twitter defines active user. Actual DD + proof inside,"Twitter ($TWTR) is falling because of a [Washington Post report that the company has been purging its user base of bot accounts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/07/06/twitter-is-sweeping-out-fake-accounts-like-never-before-putting-user-growth-risk)

&gt;Twitter has sharply escalated its battle against fake and suspicious accounts, suspending more than 1 million a day in recent months, a major shift to lessen the flow of disinformation on the platform, according to data obtained by The Washington Post.

&gt;The aggressive removal of unwanted accounts **may result in a rare decline in the number of monthly users in the second quarter, which ended last week**, according to a person familiar with the situation who was not authorized to speak. Twitter declined to comment on a possible decline in its user base.

So Wall Street is now pricing in a decline in MAU (Monthly active users) when Twitter reports results for Q2. MAU is the figure that Twitter provides in its earnings report, the company does not comment on ""total registered users"" which the company says is a useless figure.

---

It goes without saying that deleting fake accounts will not have an impact on profitability, but that is not the bet here.

I am betting on the possibility that the bot accounts being deleted were not being counted in the MAU figure in the first place. As an experiment, I created a test account last Friday when the WaPo report came out and purchased followers from a few shops that appeared when I googled ""buy twitter followers"".

All the followers that I bought ended up looking like this:

- https://twitter.com/AndreyaBosher
- https://twitter.com/EmbickNickol
- https://twitter.com/CurringtonMedha
- https://twitter.com/EdellSelvaggi

Twitter defines an ""active user"" as a user that signs into their account at least once per period. Thereby a ""Monthly active user"" is a user that signs into their account at least once per month. Twitter also reports daily active users (DAU). 

Now if you examine the few example of bot accounts that I just posted, you will see that they operate by following a predetermined number of people (in this case 125), and then they are forgotten and left there to sit. They do not post or exhibit any other kind of activity.

I am therefor drawing the conclusion that these ""fire and forget"" twitter bots create their account, blow their load and follow whoever they are instructed to follow, and then go away permanently. These types of accounts **should not be counted under twitter's definition of an active user**

0,3345,Option Trading Strategy Guide: Strangles,"Today's lesson is going to be on trading Strangles. Now what is a 'Strangle'? A Strangle is a both an out of the money call and an out of the money put.


Take this example. Suppose $SPY is at 270, an example strangle would be to be long the $275 call and long the $265 put. 


Conversely to be short the strangle, you just do the opposite. So you short the $275 call and short the $285 put.


Now you might ask, why might someone do this? Well the answer on the long side, they might not know which direction the stock will go, but they know that it is going to move in a direction (or that they know that implied volatility is going to expand), so they buy a strangle. This is different than a straddle because you buy out of the money options, rather than the at the money option so that their margin goes down less.


Now for the short strangle side, why might someone do this? Well it is to collect as much premium as possible. The best part is that you get to make your broker carry some of the risk, while you get to collect all the reward. &gt;:)


Now the truth is that is never been long a strangle, so I can't really give you pointers on how to adjust this position and what else to look for besides an expansion of implied volatility. I suppose an idea is to start off with a long strangle and if things don't go the way that you want it to, you could roll it over into a double calendar or an iron condor or something instead. 


Now here is the fun part and the real reason why I wrote this. To talk about short strangles! As a reminder, a short strangle is a short OTM put + a short OTM call.

There are two flavors the short strangle. The covered strangle and the naked strangle. The covered strangle is when you both own the stock and have the cash. An example of why you might want to do this is if you own 100 shares of $SPY and you would be glad to own more of $SPY at a certain price and would be willing to sell at some certain price as well but also want to generate lots of premium.

After you have trade a couple of options, what you will have realize is that a covered call is synthetically equal to a naked put. In order to spend less margin, you could just short 2 puts and get the same results as the covered straddle. If you don't understand why it is synthetically equivalent, don't worry about it.

The second flavor of the short strangle, is the naked strangle. In my option, this strategy is way more fun than the ones discussed above. Basically you get to have your broker take on some of risk. Now here is a check list to mark off before you trade this.

1) Is it a meme stock?


2) Is it a penny stock?


3) Is it some biotech stock with like one drug out?


3) Do the options have very little to no volume?


4) Are the bid/ask spreads on the options ridiculous? 


If you answered yes to any of those questions, then don't sell strangles on that, you are going to die.

Here are some of my tips, only short the contracts that are at least 1 SD out of the money. Another tip is to aim for 45 days to expiration, and to close a leg when the option is worth less than $0.10

In order to not die while trading this, here are some tips and tricks to use.

1) Karen the 'supertrader' tip, if one leg of the option becomes in the money, just roll that leg farther out so that you don't have to report a loss to your investors!

2) If say the stock tanks and your short put is now bleeding, one adjustment you can do is to move the short call leg up so that you can collect more premium to offset the bleeding. Conversely if it rallies, you can do the same thing except with the put wing.

3) Buy/short stock in order to neutralize your deltas.

4) Turn the leg that moved against you into a spread to cap the bleeding on that leg.

5) Doing nothing! This one actually works a lot of the time.

Here is a link on tastytrade on this strategy.

http://tastytradenetwork.squarespace.com/tt/blog/anatomy-of-a-short-strangle

It looks like they are encouraging you to naked short strangles and so if your broker is lame and gay and won't let you trade them, it looks like tastytrade is cool with you shorting these.

Now if you have Interactive Brokers, watch out since they like to margin call you for no apparent reason/charge you some gay fee for 'taking on too much risk.'

I have never heard of anyone having problems trading this on TD Ameritrade.

I hate to post old news but history repeats itself - Mind you this only goes back to June 2018 where the first rounds of tariffs were going on.  I'm livid I just took a position and boom new tariffs again.

&amp;#x200B;

From the article:

&amp;#x200B;

""**Reasons Behind the Stock’s Plunge**

The escalating fears of a trade war hampering the free flow of goods between countries are the main reasons behind the stock’s dismal performance.  In fact, on the fourth quarter conference call, FedEx’s CEO Fredrick Smith expressed his concerns on the same.

The fact that FedEx has a significant presence in China has given rise to worries over substantial revenue loss due to the weakening of trade following the tariffs. We note that FedEx opened a hub in Shanghai in January 2018 to strengthen its foothold in China.

Last week, the White House announced plans to impose 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of imports. President Donald Trump is expected to start taxing products worth $34 billion as early as Jul 6 while he will levy tariff on the additional goods of $16 billion later. Beijing said it will counter the move, imposing tariffs on U.S. soybeans and other farm products.""",2018-09-18 10:51:55,['FDX']

But, I couldn't pass up the after-hours fire sale.  Even with the modest downward adjustment to forward guidance, a 7% selloff is hardly warranted given the solid earnings beat, and the stock's already low P/E multiple.  With a stable balance sheet and a pretty damn attractive P/E multiple, I think additional downside is limited, at least in the near term.  

Depending on what the IV picture looks like in the AM, I may sell some covered calls on these shares.  The premiums should be fairly juicy.  And since I am never lucky enough to buy the bottom, the premiums will help shield my downside if this bitch decides to shed a few more percent in the AM.

If any of you degenerates have a grand long strategy for this stock, please feel free to share.  It's pretty damn hard to find value in this market.  MU @ $42-43 per share is about as good as it gets right now, in my retarded opinion.

Originally had shares and rolled over to contracts and now riding those out.

Over 100% of the float is shorted (yes for u retards this is poissible. Perelman has been snapping up shares and he wants to take the company private. They have a backdoor provision in their contracts to transfer assets away from bondholders similar to Jcrew. He wants to do this while private so they face less scrutiny etc.. whatever yada yada. Right now out of 53.5MM shares effectively 2.5MM is the float sine perelman has 85%, indexes, and a few other activists investors are holding and have the intent to hold for quite a long time as you can see by the mittleman brothers 13F filings. This thing could overshoot HEAVY in the near term and it looks like perelman is going to have to announce private real soon. He has used these tactics many times before (buy when underlying is depressed following poor earnings - even though this is attributed to front end costs). He has paid anywhere between 50-100% premium when taking companies private.

Basically long revlon and count your fucking tendies. I'm sitting on Nov 25's right now (up 214% this is excluding my previous Sept 20's which I sold and profited from aswell as the shares).

0,3390,Why $SVMK is the next $SNAP,"$SVMK, or SuveyMonkey, shares have rallied $30% in the past 5 days, with the majority of those gains coming on the heels of news of the SAP acquisition of $SVMK ""competitor"" Qualtrics. The sentiment being if SAP is willing to pay a 21.1x revenue multiple for Qualtrics, the space must be ripe for growth and therefore $SVMK is undervalued. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the problem: Qualtrics is a CX platform. $SVMK is a feature of a CX platform. This reminds me of those who thought $SNAP was a social media platform before Instagram proved their product was merely a feature of a social media platform. SAP did not buy Qualtrics because they could send surveys. They bought it because Qualtrics is an **enterprise-grade software solution** to Customer Feedback Management, of which surveys are a sizable but shrinking component. 

&amp;#x200B;

Qualtrics calls out this important distinction in their S-1:

\&gt;*Survey Tools:* Survey tools are useful for broad sampling across thousands of subjects, but lack the ability to combine data in different formats across different channels, correlate with O-data™, and apply the analytical rigor needed to determine what actions need to be taken to improve results.  
 

Need more proof?

&amp;#x200B;

Forrester, the leading market research firm in CX, [does not include $SVMK](https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Forrester+Wave+Customer+Feedback+Management+Platforms+Q4+2018/-/E-RES138491) in their analysis of the ""nine most significant"" customer feedback management providers. High-level results of that analysis can be [found here.](https://www.medallia.com/forrester-wave-2018/?utm_medium=Internal-Site-Link&amp;utm_source=Medallia&amp;utm_campaign=*Forrester-Wave-2018&amp;utm_content=Homepage-Drawer&amp;utm_term=undefined) Notice Qualtrics is 2nd in strategy, 3rd in current offering, and most importantly 1st or 2nd in market presence. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Per their S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1747748/000162828018012674/qualtricss-1.htm#s86AECE72CDD6FD36EDC828DD5009F9A4), Qualtrics has 576 customers paying more than $100,000 in annual subscriptions. This represents 52% of their subscription revenue. This is what you would expect from an enterprise software platform. 

&amp;#x200B;

By contrast, [$SVMK's S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1739936/000119312518261892/d494258ds1.htm) claims 2,900 ""organizational-level"" agreements. Sounds good. Yet those only generated 12% of revenue, or approximately $10,000 per organizational-level agreement. (Their largest shareholder is also their largest customer which is a little scary.) This is NOT an enterprise-level product. This is NOT a customer feedback management platform. This is a cheap tool used by companies to figure out what date to host their holiday party.

&amp;#x200B;

But wait, maybe as the CX space expands, companies will be using more surveys and $SVMK will see some benefit? Well, refer back to the Forrester results. The top two offerings per Forrester, Qualtrics and Medallia, both build and send their own surveys. If any of them do not, do you think they can build their own survey engine for cheaper than $SVMK's $1.6B market cap? I do. As more companies embrace customer feedback as an enterprise-wide initiative, SurveyMonkey is either not poised to take advantage by lacking an enterprise-level solution, or worst case actually stands to lose market where their simple survey is replaced by an actual platform. 

&amp;#x200B;

Their Q3 earnings show that they are making large investments, presumably to build out an enterprise-level solution. But given they are not even in the space, these headwinds feel like the investment is too little, too late. Much easier for an enterprise-quality platform to build a survey tool than for a survey tool to build an enterprise-quality platform.

&amp;#x200B;

Given their massive % of ~~retard~~ retail investors, I think it will take a bit of time for them to realize all of this so I am not expecting an immediate drop, but their Q4 earnings will show this investment is falling into a black hole and I expect the stock to pay the price.

Apple's drop in iphone sales isn't a big deal. For any of you that took a microeconomics class you may remember elasticity of demand, this is a measure of how much the demand changes for a product when the price is changed. Iphones have a relatively inelastic demand, meaning that with a change in the price, the quantity demanded by consumers will not change as much.

EXAMPLE: Price increases 20%, demand will only decrease by 10%

The image is a graphical representation of this concept.

I'm sure that when Apple decided to increase their prices they had analysts examine sales data. They likely know what they're doing. And came to the conclusion that with a price increase they could increase their overall sales revenue. Their decision to no longer report unit sales was likely to prevent a drastic drop of $AAPL. The recent decline in $AAPL is an overreaction in my opinion, and when people realize this it will return to previous highs. PAPA BUFFET knows this and he ain't worried. I'm buying $AAPL calls til I'm out of money, then I'll take a loan and buy more. TENDIES INCOMING!!!!

I'm fortunate in that I received some good advice many years back about Ally CDs. I have a $500k financial planner, my income's beneficiary.

What I'm looking for is some advice on how to guide him in handling this money after I'm gone. I know I probably need to talk to a gay conversion therapist, but I'm starting here.

Our only debt is our RH margin call ($110k left). I have a six year old cat. My weeaboo is 35.

We have maybe $70k in total ally accounts (approx. $20k in 0% checking/savings, $50k in CDs). My weeaboo makes about $40k on its own. I need to make money off some dank stonks as quick as possible ($MU, $TSLA, $NFLX, $IQ, $SPY).

We've known the timeline of my going broke for about a month. I guess that I've made peace with it, as much as one can, thirty days into a time uncertain FD sentence. I'm an autist - I have to focus on doing the things that I can control (like CD gains, which is taking care of my cat after I'm gone). I guess what I'm after is some general DD, based on the numbers above. Obviously, my cat pays off the margin call, but how should the rest of the money be allocated to CDs, $MU calls, $SPY puts, etc?

Please, help if you're able. I've lurked here long enough to know that there are many very autistiv, faggie people on this site. Happy to add any additional info you may need. Thanks in advance.

0,3482,$TSLA to $400 DD inside,"“Oh, hello”, Elon Musk says, putting a coaster under his mug of dry Cheerios and placing it on the table. “I didn't see you there.”

He looks you directly in the eye. “But you've seen me everywhere, haven't you?” A film projects behind him. Images of rockets exploding, one 65 million dollar failure after another.

“I staked my career on colonizing mars. But now my shame will no longer define my legacy. This is the day a Muskrat will rise from the ashes, adorned in its Tesla flightsuit, and ascend to immortality.”

The film changes. Images of people, their eyes wide with fear or caution, like they've never seen a camera before.

“Uncontacted indigenous people.” He pours milk into his Cheerios. “The last human beings on Earth who've never had contact with the civilized world.” He’s still pouring the milk. “But what good are people who don't purchase goods and perpetuate the menstruation-like cycle of innovation?” The milk is overflowing from the mug, leaking off the table and into his lap. The heat radiating from his boardshorts evaporates the fluid into steam on contact.

“So I asked myself, what would our heavenly father do?” He removes his shirt to reveal an elaborate crucifixion tattoo across his veiny, throbbing pectorals, his sandy brown chest hair growing around it in patches. His left nipple replaces the head of Longinus, his right the head of Mary Magdalene.

“And do you know what he told me?” He grabs you by the hand. “Do you know the universal secret?” He briefly fondles your breasts, but you push him away, flirtatiously mouthing no, no, no. You know you want him. But you don't remember how you got here. You don't remember your name. You remember nothing but Elon.

The film changes. Images of an enormous armored vessel. Militaristic on the outside, the interior exudes elegance; full bar, kitchen, gaming tables, and a huge, impenetrable observation window.

“Our Father, through his only-begotten son, came before me in a dream. The Almighty and the Christ sat side-by-side in the holiest of holies, the inner sanctum, not of heaven, but of meaning itself. And behold, I saw the Mammon. Truly I say to you, the three were not in bitter dispute, but united together, each an introgial piece of the Holy Trinity, the base-most expression of God.”

“And what did God say to you, big boy?” You say, playing footsie with his milk-soaked black business socks.

“Ignorant harlot!” He screams, throwing the mug of Cheerios and milk in your face. “Do you desire my milk so badly, you can not discern for yourself God’s message from this vision?” You shake your head no, ashamed you've displeased your master.

He rubs your head, massaging the milk on his hands deep into your scalp. “Child, do you wish to possess this esoteric knowledge?”

“Yes, Papi Musk”, you say. Your conscious mind awakens as you realize you have no control of your actions, words, or emotions. “Your lessons begin now”, he says, loosening the drawstring on his shorts.

You pull his shorts off and see a large pink udder with four teets stuffed into his Teen Titans Go! boxer-briefs. You lovingly guide a teet through the folds. It's already dripping with pre-milk. “Suck it”, he says, grabbing your hair and pulling you closer. You obey your master and begin suckling. His warm milk squirts down your throat.

“Everybody has a place in the system”, he says. “as ordained by God’s laws of nature. Even when they seem lost and useless, He appoints a prophet to help them—to do His will.” His milk is getting warmer and more viscous.

“Truly I say to you, that prophet will channel the Mammon, and through him all people will find their purpose.” His piping hot milk globs down your throat and scalds your esophagus, but you can't let go of the teet.

“The Tesla Amphibious Observation Vessel. Now the world’s leaders and innovators have a window into the lives of primitive man, commodifying their existence and finally giving them purpose.”

The film changes. Images of the vessel in New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Detroit—crushing cars, busses, and people while Elon, Jeff Bezos, Charles Koch, Oprah Winfrey, and Kanye West peer out the observation window.

“Everyone has a place in the system” he says.

0,3495,$FB discussion. Undervalued? Long and Calls?,"Disclaimer: Although it is evident from this post that I am very bullish on Facebook, all I really want to see in comments is a productive discussion. Share your opinions, question everything I have said and let's see as many different opinons as possible.

The more I really think about Facebook, the more I cannot believe how ridiculously undervalued it seems right now. 

The positives: Let's start with the numbers: double digit growth. Slowing (slowly), but still very high. Find me another company with this level of growth trading at such low multiples. I dare you. Strong balance sheet as well. Can afford to acquire any competitor that might arise. If they resist, such as Snapchat did, they will go against them will all the firepower they have. Of course the David can still beat the Goliath, but statistically looking the probability is on Goliath's side. And so is my money.

Hate iPhone? Buy a Samsung. Or Huawei. Or OnePlus. Or whatever, there is literally tens, if not hundreds of options. You are really only limited by being potentially trapped in an ecosystem, like some Apple users currently are, but next to that you can switch whenever and to whatever you want.

Want to leave Facebook? The are literally only 2 places you can go. Instagram or Snapchat. Snapchat is dying and Instagram is the new cool kid on the block. You probably either go to both or to Instagram only. In other words, you are still in Facebook ecosystem. And you are still making money for Facebook. You are just on currently to a lesser extent monetized part of their ecosystem.  

Thinking of leaving social media in general? Good luck. Social media is here to stay and will only get more and more interconnected with our lives. Facebook is on that too with Oculus. Also, I know of so many people that have already deleted Facebook in the past, only to eventually return because of School class or Work facebook groups. Also, from what I see, and how I use it as well, the Facebook is really turning into a more of a 'news' social media. The one you as an individual don't really post on so much anymore, but you check it for the groups and other general updates from sites you follow. This of course means less time spent on site, and less interaction, but both have just moved to Instagram. Instagram is the new cool kid on the block.

Personal observation: In the recent month or so I have been seeing much, much, much more ads on instagram (stories). I have only realised it yesterday, but have since talked to some friends and they also noticed it. It appears that Facebook has seriously stepped up their Instagram revenue stream game. This not only shows they are adapting, but I will probably also be reflected in the next quarter's earnings report. And this is the stuff that grey haired, bald Wall Street guy cannot see. They do not use the platform. They will only find out about it all surprisedd after the earnings releases. Almost feels like an inside information. Extra growth in Instagram revenue could help offset new personnel/security costs.

In the future I can Facebook becoming kind of like lifestyle platform, like Wechat or something. They already are working on the marketplace, dating app, VR, places ratings etc. They just need to successfully grow them, and maybe also add a payment system and they are basically an ecosystem you are 'trapped' in. Like Apple iOS. 

The negatives: Their recent privacy scandals and hacks show that the really have some internal control management issues. They have however admitted to all of them, and are actively resolving them. A lot of users have left and their reputation is damaged potentially for years to come. But on the other hand, everybody  that uses social media had already kind of knew that what they do online is not really private. They are just getting reassured about how uncomfortable that can become now. I see a potential threat in this by some massive brand, with good reputation, say Apple makes it's own social media platform. Apple is recently so 'loud' about privacy that in a way they are implying a move such as this. And that could obviously kill Facebook, fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

The FDA is planning to ""ban on the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes in tens of thousands of convenience stores and gas stations across the country"" and ""propose banning menthol in regular cigarettes."" They also want to ""impose such rules as age-verification requirements for online sales.""

[""The U.S. currently has 10 million regular e-cigarette users.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-e-cigarette-and-t-vapor-market-to-reach-8643-billion-by-2025-reports-bis-research-675808803.html)...'Retail channels such as convenience stores, vape shops and tobacco shops have been the primary distribution channel for most manufacturers, however, online channels are gaining popularity.'""


&gt;It's no secret that Juul has dominated the e-cigarette market over the past year, but just how much it has dominated is eye-popping.

&gt;[**Convenience stores sport signs boasting they sell Juul devices and pods.**](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/02/juul-e-cigarette-sales-have-surged-over-the-past-year.html) The e-cigarette has become so popular it even has its own verb: ""Juuling.""

(Emphasis added.)

&gt;Juul's dollar sales have skyrocketed 783 percent in the 52 weeks ended June 16, reaching $942.6 million, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of Nielsen data. The e-cigarette category as a whole grew 97 percent to $1.96 billion in the same period.

&gt;Juul's sales surged 882 percent in the most recent four-week period, boosting its market share to 68 percent. That's up from 27 percent for the four weeks that ended Sept. 9, 2017, according Nielsen data Juul labs provided CNBC in October.


(Note: Juul is currently a privately-held company, but its numbers are representative of the growth of the larger e-cig industry. The major tobacco manufacturers I listed in the title also sell e-cig products.)

If this ban takes effect, e-cig sales will likely take a hit. Convenience stores and gas stations vastly outnumber tobacco shops. Additionally, a potential menthol ban would seriously affect every cigarette manufacturer around.

0,3530,Splunk ($SPLK) will beat earnings on Thursday,"**TL;DR**
Buy $SPLK this week before EOD Thursday.

My position:
Nothing at the moment, sold it all after last quarter's huge beat.
Looking to enter a large leveraged position around the $90 mark this week.

**DD**
Splunk are the leaders in the Security Information Event Management (SIEM) space. If you don't know what  a SIEM tool is – read the paragraph at the bottom.
Ask anybody in cyber security what is the best SIEM tool, and they will tell you it's Splunk. They are consistently either #1 or #2 in the Gartner Magic Quadrant, see:
[Garner Magic Quadrant for SIEM, Dec 2017](https://imgur.com/a/F8ir0nD)

Cyber security and data leak risks are extremely high on the agenda lately for large organisations. It's one of the biggest fears for a C-suite exec. We've all seen the billions of dollars of damage a privacy or data leak event can cause (e.g. Equifax, Facebook), therefore these companies are willing to shell out big for the best solution.

Splunk know this, which is why they charge through the nose for their solution. They make their money through the following fees:
1)	Licencing / subscription
2)	Setup costs, i.e. Implementation/configuration (professional services/consulting)
3)	Management Services (e.g. 24/7 support, product upgrades)
4)	*Usage based* fee model (i.e. fees charged on the amount of data flowing in/out of their solution)

Now 1,2 and 3 are all standard costs associated with any regular software vendor. Very normal stuff.
But #4 is why I think Splunk are positioned to keep crushing earnings. 

I feel that over time existing clients will:
1)	Onboard more and more systems onto Splunk. E.g. For their initial setup, perhaps they only onboarded their production Windows Active Directory environment. But now after seeing the value Splunk provides, they want to onboard their Finance system, HR system, Payroll system, Procurement system etc.
2)	As these companies grow in size, the usage of these systems also grow, generating an additional proportionate number of logs.
3)	As cyber threats become more advanced and evolve, even more systems and more logs will be ingested. E.g. Firewall logs, Switch/Router logs, CASB logs etc.

And because Splunk charge based on usage, these factors above will lead to increased revenue and beating earning expectations YoY.

Now you might be thinking, well won't these organisations just switch to a more cost effective solution then?
The simple answer is that none of these companies are going to take all the time and effort to set up Splunk, connect all their systems to it, configure all the rules, then years down the line say, ""Oh wait, these Splunk usage fees are getting a little high. Maybe we should switch to a cheaper alternative."" 
Once a company has committed to Splunk they are basically locked in, which is why I think they are poised to continually crush earnings – at least in the short term before other solutions catch up.
As long as Splunk remain as a leader in the Gartner magic quadrant, it will be the go-to SIEM solution for all the biggest private and public sector organisations who have enough cash to execute a mature cyber security strategy.

To use an analogy most people would understand: Imagine a world where you know your mobile data usage is going to increase over time, but you can't switch phone providers because:
1)	It is very expensive and time consuming to switch providers
2)	You are already with the best provider, so while others may be cheaper, they are also slower have less coverage.
3)	You're rich, and using mobile data on your phone is important to you.


**What is a SIEM tool?** 
All IT systems (e.g. servers, databases, applications, hardware) will generate security logs of events that have happened, e.g. a remote login to one of your production servers at 3AM from a Russian IP. An event like this is obviously very important for an organisation to identify and monitor from a cyber security perspective. 
However because a large organisation will likely have hundreds of IT systems, each spitting out thousands of security logs every day, without some sort of smart analytics solution, an organisation cannot effectively react in time to such events by manually reading through logs to detect suspicious activity.

That's where a SIEM tool comes in. You can set one up, point all your systems to send its security logs to it, and then set up rules and patterns to alert when critical security events occur. E.g. in the example above, if anyone remotely logs into you production servers overnight – you can set up email and SMS alerts to go out to your key cyber security staff in the night so they can respond accordingly.

In the NIST cyber security framework https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework security event audit logging is basically the only solution that makes up the ""Detect"" function.

Guarantee you analysts will raise price targets tomorrow on the back of positive announcements at Signal conference. Pay partnership is with Stripe. Developers love Twilio

Stock has been hammered past two weeks due to global macro environment but fundamentals remain very strong

Twilio announced acquisition of sendgrid (leading email API platform) which basically rounds out the communications platform it offers. Email was the missing piece that people were wondering why Twilio doesn’t integrate and now they have it. Acquisition is via all-stock transaction. Despite this analysts remain bullish due to long term synergies and the fact that SendGrid userbase is different from Twilio’s which allows for cross selling opportunities 

Twilio build is a program for consulting/tech firms to help integrate Twilio with customers and spread awareness

Earnings date is scheduled for Nov 6 which is the day of the US house election. Twilio has developed an API for voting so there may be some parallels here between the two. 

Street Revenue estimates for Q3 aren’t even high and Twilio may blow past them given existing customers are spending more $ on increasing # of products 

TLDR: long TWLO calls expiring post earnings are the play here. Main risk is overall market selloff from worries around rising rates etc continuing causing tech shares to tumble further.  Twilio’s fundamentals are very strong and correction in past few weeks creates good buying opp. I also wrote a comment on here right before Q2 earnings predicting a major beat.

What do we have here? A bio play.

Progenics Pharmaceuticals has produced a new drug called Azedra. Azedra treats malignant adrenal gland tumors for which there is currently no FDA-approved treatment. Everyone is pretty gungho on it as it has proven success and there is no current drug for the ultra rare disease and it was fast tracked by the FDA. I think peak sales they're estimating 300 million. 

Spooky Part:
When second trials were done, they were not as promising as the first time. Also, This PDUFA was originally for March 22 however it was delayed to July 30. It was delayed apparently due to the submission of supplemental Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls information that the FDA requires further time to review (whatever that means). 

Side note: 
Progenics also already has a marketed drug - Oral Relistor (Shoutout to everyone in this sub who was here for that approval) that is partned with VRX (yikes) , but has showing significant increase in sales.  

Take this info as you want and obviously do your own DD. I think we see a runup in the next two weeks. I bought some Nov calls, but be weary of the bid/ask prices. Also Aug calls IV is high as a kite.

2) China is pushing the hardest for EV adoption

3) Foreign car manufacturers are uncompetitive in China due to import taxes and tariffs

4) Two largest players in China EV Market are BYD Co. (backed by Buffet) and Nio (backed by Tencent, Sequoia Capital, others; recently invested by Ballie Gifford \[stated in DD last week\]

5) Strong products and pipeline

0,3587,Walgreens: Tendies on the horizon,"Disclaimer: I work at store level and am inebriated

&amp;#x200B;

\- Why do I believe that there will be a chance to make any tendies off of $WBA? 

Recently had to take a slap on the wrist from the SEC and also just gave all lower level clerks a raise to $10/hr ([est. cost of 100 million against the 350 million tax savings coming with the tax cuts](http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-walgreens-pay-increase-0329-story.html)). On Nov. 4 this year the plan to revamp their rewards program to make it less enticing to what I would describe as super shoppers or just customers who take full advantage of any and all rewards they can earn or redeem. The one big change that is coming is the fact that the max rewards you can cash in on one transaction are currently 50 bucks and the new ones will be 5 bucks in on transaction. Over the long term I do not think this will prove to be a bad move but these two things combined with the big headlines will lead to big swings in the price esp closing in on 3\\19 which is when they should be reporting their earnings for the FQ that ends in 2/19 if the schedule is similar to last year. The reason I believe this will cause some movement is because for the most part $WBA is rated on the greener end of meh by most analysts and these changes will effect what I consider to be the two big ""sentiment"" factors in retail being operation costs and id sales/same store sales/yoy sales. Underneath I will include more pros/cons and my eventual yolo play:

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

* Annual rev. growth beats industry avg
* Insiders are buying more than they are selling currently
* The margins they make on generics are large and the % they sell is going up over time
* Took on a ton of debt in 2015 and since then are efficiently handling it
* CVS is dumb and runs their operation like ass (pure opinion)
* Customer service is a legit core value and definitely shows throughout the brand 

Cons:

* They aren't necessarily doing ""great"" by any measure/metric
* In q1 2018 they said that they were trying to increase front-end sales but from what I see a few of their policies lack any real understanding of what it takes to grow their front-end sales
* While the boots part of the alliance isn't large Europe is a dumpster fire right now
* The above reason I listed will more than likely cause problems with customer retention in the near future
* There is a ton of negative feedback coming from the store level employees about the proposed rewards changes
* one of the ways they are trying to counteract the wage increase is by lowering P.T.O. rates for employees 

If anyone has any arguments agai4/nst/for I would like to hear them.

Earnings on 10/18 should be another surprise gain so get in your 10/19 calls. I'm all in on multiple call levels you can choose your risk but I expect double digit gains.  

The stock is extremely undervalued compared to its AUM growth which is going to continue to grow exponentially. I see the stock going to 40+ in a couple of months and even higher once its unrealized value in its current assets kicks in. 

Feel free to pick up some of the stock and once new fund launches get announced, cash it out for 20% gains.

0,3604,$CNI and $CP - post-correction rebound easy money play,"Transcript from DD research call:

$CNI will be a $135 dollar stock after earnings (Oct 23rd) 

Billions in capital investment has boosted an already huge profit margin &amp; is aiming for 50pc

Key Date in 2019 when Electronic Driver Logs become mandatory for drivers... all the drivers running long miles illegally will get shut down (just happened in the us causing over the road pricing to go up 35 percent within 1 month) this quickly shifted capacity to the rail causing the current spike in earnings

That was a US ELD Implementation, these are Canadian companies. The Canadian ELDs is going to destroy the highway market to the benefit of rails.

Yea I dont see it until 2027ish But I will be monitoring The rails are gonna explode the next 3-5 years

That was US and cross border Canadian drivers only And that was enough to increase the over the road price by 35 percent.

Volumes shifted to the rail line causing the recent surge in earnings (plus the economy being a bigger factor potentially)

Now for Canadian domiciled drivers it's happening in 2019 at the end.

That impacts long mile drivers the most. Canadian rails are all about long miles and can absorb all the additional over the road capacity.

Will grow from volumes going from road to rail + when the road prices spike say 30 percent (competition for drivers and increasing wages = same profit percent for road companies but higher revenue) the rail also increases price 25 percent but with the same input costs

Will take 6-12 months for the earnings spike after the ELD date

Rails are getting faster too. Takes 2.75 days for a team of 2 east indians to drive from Toronto to Calgary in 1 truck. Cost =5500. It now takes the rail 3.5 days and costs 3300

Down from 5 days 2 years ago. And the drivers are making maybe 5 percent bottom line vs the rails 35 percent.

CP

Back story - the rail needs local drivers near each terminal to pickup on their chassis and containers to ingate the train at the terminals

Makes sense?

CNs drivers are all unioned. CP has historically contracted out all of the drayage (the act of picking up and bringing the container to the rail)

In order to gain market share from CN, CP has done this as a cost plus through - accounting for about 20 percent of the cost of the rail move

So they were 5 percent lower than CN. Rails are at capacity now So at start of this quarter they increased the drayage price to be for profit So \~20 percent of their revenue was at cost Now it's at 40 percent margin

Cnr didnt get this advantage because they were running it with CN unionized drivers

A big component of the rails revenue comes from grain, bulk services, oil and partnerships with the ocean lines

I dont understand that stuff much I cant see tariffs being good for ocean lines coming from Asia and the EU though

A lot of our pricing with the rail is setup to get containers positioned back in Vancouver and Halifax and that hasnt shifted so that is my leading indicator to if something is fked from those revenue streams. Which is something but not enough

You can talk about the capital investments cp has made with new tracks and hoppers and rail cars

Also effective this quarter they retired the daily train line gta &gt; qc. It was profitable as a percentage (over 50) but low revenue. They allocated all that capacity and assets and yard space to long haul runs to western Canada. Lower margin but much higher revenue. Overall profit increase.

Gta &lt;&gt; QC\*

They retired it in the previous quarter but the benefit in capacity not released until this quart

Also they have expanded there operation in Chicago to actually be functional. They did not have drayage contracts in place so clients needed to use there own drayage services to connect to the Chicago line. Now they have drayage partners in place and are actually marketing the area.

0,3742,$MU DD (srs),"Thought I'd share a wall of text I found on Marketwatch following the UBS downgrade to instill some confidence for fellow bagholders:

""Legacy thinking at best - UBS fails to understand the fundamental changes which have occurred in the memory and, especially, storage sectors.  Forward thinking people perceive the sectors as now almost entirely dominated by a disciplined oligopoly with extremely high entry barriers combined with at least steady growth of memory demand and high growth of storage demand.  This will not abate - cyclically is, by any significant measure, a thing of the past and will not recur for the foreseeable future and longer.  And neither sector is commodity in nature now, nor ever will be again.

UBS’s thinking appears to be grounded in past times when personal computers dominated demand for memory and storage and numerous fabricators with only modest entry barriers addressed the demand, thus causing the technology to appear to be commodity in nature.  Those times are utterly over and absolutely won’t return - demand drivers are now dramatically more broad, robust, and accelerating with no end in sight, fabrication technology is immensely more advanced and thus entry barriers are extremely high, and the fabrication family shrank to a quite small and well disciplined oligopoly which has consistently demonstrated wise restraint of fabrication facility growth.

Memory is necessary as a matter of processing logistics.  But whether based upon carbon, iron oxide, silicon, or chalcogenide, all knowledge resides in storage.  Including AI knowledge.  And in the inherently competitive Universe we reside within you simply can’t know too much.  So as AI expands the demand for storage will expand even faster.  And Strong AI (https://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) will consume storage insatiably.  And this storage sector reality will become increasingly clear as the investing community learns that storage is absolutely key to broad and dramatic technology change - change which is defining the lives and fortunes of all people, corporations, institutions, and even sovereign nations on this planet.

On 21 May 2018 Micron will hold an analyst and investor event (http://Investors.Micron.com/?_ga=2.59001453.1182497785.1522947257-1574198886.1475610820).  In my estimation the firm will espouse absolutely solid confidence in their near and long term future in both memory and storage.  And that won’t be the only counter to this myopic UBS analysis - contrary opinions will flow from the vast majority if not all credible observers in the meantime.

Micron, with a 5.79 P/E, leader of the pack technology position in storage, and superbly growing demand firmly rooted in fundamental planetary technology acceleration, is an investor’s dream come true - already superb stock price growth notwithstanding it will continue to rise at a substantially greater rate than the broad market as the new realities of the memory and storage sectors become increasingly clear to everyone and the firm's performance metrics continue their confident march higher.  Those who study this landscape carefully and have solid technology credentials already perceive this.  And enlightenment will spread as Micron’s realities become increasingly undeniable.

In my opinion this UBS downgrade is at best incompetent, should be viewed as such, and, as the comments already offered here indicate, will be viewed as such by the broader technology and investing community.

It’s almost impossible for some to perceive change even as it’s occurring and accelerating.  But even myopic eyes will eventually be forced to acknowledge reality.  But in the meantime the portfolio of anyone who follows such myopic observers will have suffered terribly...""",2018-04-06 05:26:02,['MU']

0,3752,YOLO options play: 1000% or 0%. Long DD inside for Portola Pharmaceuticals ($PTLA).,"This right here is a true all-or-nothing options play that will either make you rich, or lose you absolutely everything you put in. There are 2 possible avenues for success if you follow my line of thinking. I will go over both in more detail below. The second play is more likely to succeed, but the potential gains are closer to 500% with the potential loss still 100%.

You can skip the first part if you don't care about this drug's background.

* **Background Information (you can skip this)**
---

Portola Pharmaceuticals ($PTLA) has a PDUFA date of May 4th for their blockbuster drug, Andexanet Alfa (AndexXa). A long time ago, I wrote a controversial ""hit piece"" against this company on Seeking Alpha; claiming that the drug was going to fail its FDA decision, which it did. The drug is promising, but PTLA cut way too many corners during their first attempt and didn't test for enough things. You can't cut corners when testing life-or-death kind of drugs. AndexXa is one of those life-or-death drugs. PTLA ran and wrote up the most loosely tied together study I've seen in a while for such an important drug, and they were served a CRL. This, to me, means the company has toxic and/or retarded upper management because no qualified professional would have recommended such a bare-bones approach. Just from reading it, you can tell upper management is cocky because they came across a blockbuster drug and felt that they couldn't possibly fuck it up. *Narrator: But they did.*

PTLA's next PDUFA was moved up from February of this year to May 4th. Bad news, right? Not exactly. AndexXa is one of those drugs that the FDA can't make a wrong decision on. I guess you could again point a finger at PTLA's management for handing them yet another unsatisfying trial, but we have no way of knowing that this time around. PTLA did not release a full study for their second decision, so I can't read it and know for sure.

The thing is, despite PTLA's seemingly earnest attempts to fail another FDA decision, AndexXa is such a strong drug that it would be hard for the FDA to say no again. AndexXa is sorely needed. The FDA could give AndexXa a Black Box Warning, only approving it for intracranial bleeding, and hospitals would still stock up on it as an essential drug. There will undoubtedly be tons of off-label use. I believe AndexXa *will* come with a Black Box Warning, with heavy limitations on its usage, but I also believe that it won't matter because there is no real alternative -- I predict that it may only be approved for treating Intracranial Hemorrhages. However, hospitals will use AndexXa regardless of the warnings, seeing as the only other option is death.

* **The Plays** 
---

I haven't even bought into these options yet, but I will over the course of this month, so you're all getting early access to my vast collection of knowledge. 

-

* 1000% or 0%

This is the dumbest play you could make here but also the most compelling one. For this play, you pour all of your money into **May 18 2018 50.00 Calls**. When and if AndexXa is approved, which I think will come with a harsh Black Box Warning, I believe PTLA will open at around $45/share. This will be much lower than expected had AndexXa instead come with a clean approval. But as positive sentiment rolls in, I believe that PTLA's price will rise from its opening price to at least $60/share as investors realize that Black Box Warnings don't matter for drugs like AndexXa. Institutional investors aren't stupid and I'm not a genius, so there might not be *any* negative sentiment and the price could just open up at $60+ in the first place. I'm not playing 4D chess here. 

Regardless, these calls are worth roughly $1 each now, so if underlying share price goes up to $60/share, they will go up to $10+ each. A gain of 1000% or more. Personally, I believe PTLA deserves to go up to around $80/share with approval of AndexXa, but that's just my personal belief and I can't vouch for an increase like that with certainty. 

-

* 500% or 0%

Same thing as above, but with an equal split between **May 18 2018 45.00 Calls** and **May 18 2018 40.00 Calls**. The loss here is still 100%. 

-

* More complicated plays for gains either way

There is no doubt some complicated options play here where you can bet for both sides, with a lean towards one end of the decision, and potentially come out with money either way. I'm not really about that life because I'm going in deep for an approval. But the potential is there for the less gambling-prone crowd.

0,3762,"In preparation for $YQ IPO today, I've watched 2 hours of Media 17 (their streaming platform) so you don't have to. Retarded ""DD"" / review inside.","Here's the concept, buckos. Basically, hundreds of Asian women are constantly streaming just themselves eating or whatever on this platform. All they do is sit there and interact with the audience. No tiddies, I promise you. I checked. Exhaustively. Here are some things that surprised me about the platform: 

- Insane donations were just rolling in. Whichever girl was at the top of the stream list was bringing in constant ""points,"" which I believe to be more or less like Twitch Bits. The translation was spotty, idk. And when I say insane, I mean FUCKING MIND BOGGLING. This could be a full time living with a little more scale. These boys are competing like wolves for 2 seconds in a woman's spotlight.

- There was a lot of activity beyond ""peak"" hours. It was about noon in Japan, not evening or night, but still there were probably a hundred-ish Japanese streamers, ALL with viewers and ALL getting donations. It wasn't like Twitch where you just sometimes donate when you can afford to. It is ASSUMED that you will donate if you use the platform. The psychology behind it is weird as all hell and the girls act like they're gonna cry if you give them one dollar. I can confirm this. Long and short is that the community as a whole is built around the casual transfer of these points. It's like tipping in the US except for everything constantly. 

- MUCH more of Asia was represented than expected. Most DDs have this app solidly locked into Taiwan, its home market. This is not the case. Japan was a serious contender, if not dominator, for active user numbers tonight. There were even some Hong Kong and Malaysia based streamers. 

- No nudes, and also some popular dudes. Guess Asians can be gay too.

Let's talk about financing. How the fuck is Musk going to pay for the buyout? How is funding secured? He's gonna pay for it. That's fucking right. Let's take a look at shareholder's options:

1. Sell your shares to Tesla for [$420](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/242/293/d49.jpg).

2. Hang on and get private TSLA stock.

3. Sell to the shorts for *motherfucking dump trucks worth of money*.

Obviously shareholders aren't going to choose option 1 except for those Ally account motherfuckers. So he'll take *a little* money from the shorts to cover those assholes. More importantly, let's talk about how he prevents option 3.

**Disclaimer- I have no fucking clue if this next part is even legal. But, [get in loser. We're committing securities fraud.](https://i.redd.it/7jroz9aeire11.jpg)) **

Once TSLA goes private, only people who previously held stock will be able to buy or sell. And, if you want to buy, it has to be as a ratio of what you currently hold. Sold all your shares to shorts? Fuck off, bucko. Enjoy your dirty scab money. Sold all *but one* share to shorts? Welcome to the club buddy, but you'll never hold a sizable number of shares. Once you're in though, you'll get some fucking sweet perks. Discounted Teslas? Free supercharging for life? Early access to order new models? You bet your fucking ass.

With that taken care of, shareholders are eager to join the club with as many tickets as possible, and shorts won't be able to buy stock from anyone but *motherfucking Elon Musk*. That's when the $11,000/share play happens. Right now, there's [fucking 35M shares short sold](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/tsla/short-interest). Let's say the shorts get off easy, and *only* need to sell half of those shares to Papa Musk/TSLA. *That's fucking $192.5B.* Musk, being the generous type, splits it between Tesla and SpaceX. Boom, bitches. TSLA buys out every other car manufacturer in the world, forces them to only make electric cars, and we're all taking vacations *to fucking Mars on a BFR*. That's right, Papa Musk is *literally taking us to Mars* with this play. And the share holders who own that private TSLA stock get first dibs with *premium space-cabins*.

In summary, fucking buy as many shares as you can and [get your ass to Mars](https://i.imgur.com/nhMp8Dm.jpg).

*Once again I know jack shit about stocks, the world, basic monetary or rocket propulsion principals so please don't listen to any of my advice.*",2018-08-09 23:46:40,['TSLA']

0,3809,$TUR &amp; Lira -- Buy FDs,"""Pastor Brunson trial is said to resume next week"" -Turkish news

BUT,

IF they let him go: TUR going to $MUn, Lira problems resolved when sanctions lifted.

However, Erdogan is between a rock and a hard place - He can't let the $PEDO go (shows weakness, sad!), even tho it solves the immediate economic issues levied against him.

but he can 'watch' (read: let) a Judge in Turkey release him, and say the Judicial Process took place and it was out of his hands

So the obvious move is get TUR Weekly calls Expiring Aug 17th, I have a spread of 20, 21, 22 calls.

Given the price was 2.38 that means roughly $830,000 is betting on a very near term time frame that Tesla will drop well over $100 in stock price.

Kinder Morgan is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in North America. They own shitload of pipelines and terminals transporting natural gas, gasoline, crude oil, CO2 and more. Recently, the Canadian government stepped in and bought the transcanadian pipeline from KMI for $3.45B US dollars. The First Nation people have been haggling about this pipeline construction on their land which led to delays and increased costs. But the deal with canadian government should resolve this quicker. The way this deal is structured is that KMI will still own the pipeline when its up and running and the govt will only keep part of the profits. Official statement\-  “It’s not the intention of government of Canada to be a long term owner of project.""

Bull case\-

1. 4.75&amp;#37; dividends (will rise more next year)
2. Huge insider buying last quarter
3. Stock price at 2 year low; lot of room for run up
4. Transcanada pipeline sale eliminates regulatory and political risks
5. Owner and CEO work for $1/year salary

Price target\- $20 by end of year (current price\- $16.9; I bought shares at $15.8 and Jan $20 leaps)

It had a big ass spike at open today to 146 - no idea why - and I was tempted to bail but it happened so fast I couldn't really figure out a reasonable limit price before it started to drift back down

At any rate it's currently sitting at 140 having recovered from lows around 133 last week after the post ER dump. Looking for an exit at or above 150 within a month so I think there's still plenty of upside left here.

0,3914,"Long $AMD, Massive Intel In-Hardware Security Bug Found (Hotfix Requires -30% Perf Penalty)","You faggots doubted SuBae, but her journey to the moon is undaunted by your cum-guzzling ways. 

Confirmed homosexual firm, $INTC, will be announcing [a massive in-hardware security bug in its modern processors that will require a **-30% performance penalty** to hotfix it](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7nl8r0/intel_bug_incoming/). This will notably affect large datacenter customers such as $GOOG and $AMZN (short them for maximum tendies). 

* As an in-hardware bug, this is not easy to fix and will require a brutal hotfix as a temporary measure. A less destructive fix will not be available until the hardware is replaced with updated models in the coming years (as if customers would choose to buy more $INTC products after this!). 

* The bug is currently under embargo much like $INTC is still officially in the closet. In the coming days, $INTC will publicly acknowledge its sexual orientation and the existence of this bug. 

* [$INTC's CEO sold off $11M of $INTC stock less than two weeks ago](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/12/19/intels-ceo-just-sold-a-lot-of-stock.aspx) and now holds the bare minimum number of shares required by the CEO according to $INTC by-laws. Looks like he's getting his yacht while he still can! 

* Competing processors made by SuBae are confirmed to not be affected by this vulnerability as their architecture is much girthier. 

This leaves **SuBae poised to fuck the competition up the ass** on large datacenter contracts. 

* $AMD has recently [ramped up production on their 32-core ""EPYC"" CPU](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12032/amd-announces-wider-epyc-availability-and-rocm-17-with-tensorflow-support) that competes in the datacenter market. 

* Not only does the 32C EPYC have more cores than $INTC's flaccid 28C CPU, but [EPYC costs half as much](https://www.anandtech.com/show/11544/intel-skylake-ep-vs-amd-epyc-7000-cpu-battle-of-the-decade/10). 

* SuBae is rumored to release an [EPYC 2.0 with an even more turgid 64-core CPU as early as 2019](https://hothardware.com/news/amd-epyc-2-64-cores-128-threads-and-256mb-l3-cache). 

 * Impotent traitor, [Raja Kodorki, is confirmed to not be involved with Epyc in any way](http://www.pcgamer.com/amd-radeon-boss-raja-koduri-joins-intel-to-work-on-integrated-and-discrete-graphics/) and will only be adding performance issues to $INTC products going forward. 

* SuBae won't rest until EPYC is packed deep into datacenters everywhere, leaving $INTC frustrated and on the streets to beg for tendies.

DD:  
  
Really have mixed opinions here. Short interest is surprisingly low, so maybe its not oversold, but it's clearly been called out as a loser plenty by analysts, and it's way down in the last week, month, 6 months, year, etc.  
  
GE seems to be having a hard time making a profit, and it sounds like there's some sort of restructuring going on. Between the dividend being cut and the last earnings report, things haven't been good for GE. however, their market cap is close to their annual revenue (mkt cap 120B vs annual revenue ttm 121.5B), so if they can turn things around it could pop up.  
  
My thoughts are that the next earnings report (4/20/2018) has a good chance of triggering a large movement in either direction. The expectations are considerably lower than in the past, and if they can meet or exceed them, especially with all the negative press, the stock price could pop upward. Likewise, if they can't meet even these newer, reduced expectations, confidence will continue falling and may result in a big drop.  
  
With that in mind, im looking at an options play with a 5/18 expiry (to allow for a run either direction after the 4/20 earnings). Furthermore, options (at least the closest ITM to current price) look relatively cheap. A call would need a 3% increase or so to breakeven and a put would only need a little more than 1% decrease.  
  
I'm holding off on opening this til after the Fed meeting to reduce uncertainty at the time i open the position.

If market sentiment with institutional investors is that the semiconductor industry is cyclical and the warning signs are flashing that the industry is beginning to peak, great earnings mean nothing without ***KILLER*** guidance. I don't mean decent guidance, but consistent \~30% growth. 

Time to face facts that recognize the 2 years of amazing growth rates are beginning to slow. Does that mean these companies are fucking up?

- HMNY/MoviePass is cratering and everyone is cancelling. Just look at the sentiment on their subreddit /r/moviepass/ and /r/MoviePassClub/

- AMC launched ""A-List"" 7 weeks ago and has been gaining all the MoviePass exhiles. Extremely positive sentiment on /r/AMCsAList/. So early too, only 2315 subscribers at the moment

- Now AMC is starting to brag about it https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180816005658/en/Weeks-AMC-Stubs-A-List-Records-1-Million

- Yahoo Finance picking up on it too https://finance.yahoo.com/news/260-000-reasons-amc-stubs-140000639.html?.tsrc=rss

- 1,000,000 in attendance in 7 weeks.

- 260,000 paid enrolled members in 7 weeks

- Up from 175,000 enrollments in 5 weeks since launch. That means 84,000 people signed up in 2 weeks

- Original estimate was 500,000 members by June 2019. AMC is going to kill that.

- August is a low month for movies so AMC will be getting sweet CONSISTENT profits. A-List requires a 3-month commitment, credit card charged monthly, so that is a minimum guaranteed $5.2M = 260K * $20 for August, September, October, and only gonna grow.

- Yesterday we just closed above a crucial resistance line https://i.imgur.com/gBzOhp8.png

- Zooming out, we can see that AMC used to be as high as $36! https://i.imgur.com/C0KRI4H.png

Altogether this is the perfect storm for an INSANE run-up.

- **Great Sentiment and FREE PR:** Everyone knows that MoviePass was a disaster and is flocking to AMC A-List as the sustainable alternative. Word travels extremely fast via word of mouth. AMC even knows this and is PROMISING a 12-month protection on any changes in price and benefits. 

- **Technical Analysis:** Graphs show we're crossing a resistance line and historically AMC has seen much higher prices

- **Fundamentals:** The business model works and they own the entire experience

- **Options Play:** Volatility isn't priced in yet so $AMC 9/21 $20 calls have to potential to make you 6-10X

0,3956,[SERIOUS] How do wash sales work?,"From what I understand I can't just harvest losses from taxes.  


My naive understanding as a noob trader was originally that if I earned lets say 200k in a year on gains, and I had 40k of losses that I realized, my net gains would be 160k. However, if I purchase a similar equity for the same 40k loss equity, then I would actually not claim the 40k loss equity, and still be taxed with the assumption that I earned 200k despite losing 40k.   


However reading the document, what I'm seeing is, it's more like, if I bought 10k shares of the 40k loss equity, the cost basis would say that I paid 50k on the 10k worth of shares, and if I sell those cost basis 50k shares (valued at 10k) then I can realize that 40k loss later however it has to be in a context where I avoid triggering a wash sale again.  


So if I sell the 50k cost basis shares after it rises 10k to a value of 20k, I can claim a loss of 30k if I sell at that new price point and now it should affect my taxes and be a loss, right?

There you go. Mecedes admits that they had to spend more then initially planned 12 billion to get an electric SUV production ready. That is one model ready and a few more to come.

On top if that Tesla EV technology is probably several years ahead and they have a supercharging networks that traditional car makers don't have.

Lads, I've benefited quite a bit from multiple subs and wanted to give my two cents about a stock I see immense potential in(will put this elsewhere as well)

AVMXY is Avita medical. It's an Australian company listed as an OTC. Their claim to fame is a product called RECELL. 

What RECELL basically does is use a RES system which is regenerative epithelial suspension for burn victims. It is an autologous suspension that contains cells necessary to regenerate epidermis and provides a way to above closure if burn wounds. We all know burns aren't going away anytime soon and be seen in anyone from combat victims to fire victims or car accidents. Their product mainly comes into play for third degree burns and sometimes in second degree burns where skin grafting may be needed(taking skin from one part of the body and placing it on another). They did a multi centered randomized  controlled trial which was published which showed that patients who got their product RECELL essentially :
- required 97% less skin graft than those who did not
- had possible faster wound healing
- had less pain during recovery (burns are obv painful)

This is huge and potentially transformative for the burns industry. It is not currently approved but it's PMA application is currently being reviewed by the FDA and a decision is likely in Q3. The company is very confident that this will be approved and has already started production. Earlier in the year the FDA approved an increase in the number of patients who could be treated with RECELL under its compassionate use of investigational decide exemption program(basically allowing experimental therapy in extreme cases). They thus used it on 108 patients.this and its study results almost guarantees approval of the product which will be huge.

Imagine every burn center carrying Recell if it is approved. That's big.

I see one of a few possibilities:
-it gets listed on NASDAQ
- it gets bought out by another company
- nothing happens and it loses steam

I think the third is very unlikely given how this product can change management of burns. The first two possibilities are likely. It is currently $1.47/share which is still cheap. I can't predict how high it'll go but I do see an upward trajectory.

Constraints:
It is an OTC stock and these entail more risk than other stocks since they aren't as ""vetted."" That being said, they have already started in Europe and china so that's a good sign.
Also, interestingly it's been very quiet. Other than a couple of people mentioning it before, I haven't really seen it ""take off"" on Reddit. I believe mainly coz it's an OTC.

I see big things for AVMXY and I just bought quite a bit over the last week. FYI I am not trying to shamelessly promote this. I'm trying to give my two cents as DD and if you guys like please research the stock, company and the medical evidence. DONT  buy just coz I said so. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.

They have very little debt and make a fuckton of money. So naturally it's eating shit near 5 year lows and down to $320 off it's ATH of $580. So why will it go back up?

First of all, REGN makes a best-in-class drug for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) called Eylea. And we all know $AMD has gone up 40% in the last month, which is clearly related. They're going to be selling this shit in China soon, which means lots more squinty eyes to treat, and more revenue. I know the C-word has been scaring a lot of you lately, but this is still a big opportunity. Don't fucking wait. 

Second, they just made a dope-ass eczema drug. Eczema is a shitty allergic condition where your skin is red and dry all the time. I have it, so I can confirm it sucks donkey cock. REGN just released a drug called Dupixent, which takes a steaming dump on eczema until your skin is as smooth as a baby's ass. Drug sales sucked last quarter, but they're still in ramp phase and 90% of people refill their prescriptions. Oh, by the way, this shit costs $30k/year. They just finished their clinical trials for adolescents, who make up more than 25% of eczema sufferers. Expect this fucker to ramp. 

Third, y'all ever hear of something called the allergic triad? It's when people with eczema also have allergies and asthma. Your body is a piece of shit that is allergic to literally everything. Remember that eczema drug we talked about? Turns out it shits on those related conditions, and it's going through clinical trials for asthma, food allergies, and nasal polyps. That means more revenue and some protection against competitors in the eczema space. 

Still not good enough for you? Our nigga Shkreli owns it:   https://youtu.be/X-XFxDANS6U?t=838

Now a couple of bad points:

- Most of their money comes from AMD, and drug competition is getting tighter. Theirs is still the best, but w/e.

- Wall Street hates this stock. CEO is more interested in making drugs than placating analysts. Good or bad depending on how you see it. 

- $320/share is a lot for you poor autists.

Buy shares or LEAPS; who knows when the run-up will happen. I'm in for about $19,000. Because the stock has dropped so much, there's not much downside risk, aside from Eylea sales eating shit next Q. Even during last week's market bed-shitting, it only dropped 1-2%. It has more sales and better prospects than last year, but is trading at a 37% discount. So yeah, buy it.

0,4138,The eCommerce/fintech/small-biz-tech space generally is really heating up this year. $SQ $SHOP $PYPL,"Good morning!

Small timeline:

* Verifone (PAY) was acquired in early April.

* Square (SQ) acquires Weebly in late April (to round out itself in eCommerce, which was its weakness vs Shopify)

* PayPal acquires iZettle in May (to compete with SQ where they failed in the past with its homegrown product). iZettle was about to IPO with a 1.1bn valuation, PYPL pays 2.2bn for it. If this is overpaying, it signals a validation of SQ's business model, and that PYPL is giving up on their homegrown stuff (called PayPal Here).

* Square just yesterday issues $750 in convertible notes (I have a lot of speculation on this one, but something big is brewing)

* Adobe acquired Magento today (SHOP stock way down on the news)

Earlier, when Amazon mulled p2p payments (Square has Cash App, PYPL has Venmo), both stocks dip on the announcement, which was otherwise pretty hollow PR. Amazon actually had a Square/iZettle competitor called Amazon Register that they shut down back in 2015, so I would not be surprised if they want to get back into transaction spaces. Also wouldn't be surprised if they made a bid for SHOP or SQ within 2 years in order to get into eCommerce and small biz tech generally.

Both SQ and SHOP and PYPL have had nice years, stock price wise. But on the 52week SQ is up most of alll: 

**$SQ**: +169.2%

**$PYPL**: +63.3% 

**$SHOP**: +61.3% (this was higher until very recently)

**$PAY**: 28.7% - Even though its getting acquired, investors have barely made any money in the last year compared to the other three!

Disclosure: I'm watching this space very closely and am long SQ, AMZN. (edit: and now a very small call position in SHOP as of ten seconds ago, intended to be short term because of today's perceived overreaction. This is more of a bet than a position. I will not be long SHOP long term.)

Let's go over the results for yesterday:

**FORECAST**

**ADP Nonfarm Employment Change (Apr)**

Predicted: 228

Actual: 204

Motherfuckers revised their forecast again. I treat the ADP Nonfarm report a little differently, since it's so fucking retarded, and set the bar at ""Did it beat or did it miss?"" If my prediction was also a beat, I count that as a good prediction (although it's still technically wrong in this case).

**WHAT TO EXPECT**

Predicted: Red

Results: Red

My record, so far: 10/13 (76.92% -- up from 75%)

**ANY REVISIONS?**

N/A -- if my guess is good for the day, I have to let it ride.

**ANYTHING ELSE?**

How about that $TSLA earnings call last night? My put is going to make me some mad bank today. I haven't decided whether to keep the call yet, but I'm leaning toward closing it later today or tomorrow.

US and China are finally actually talking to each RE: trade war. This is the first bit of good news we've seen in -- how long has it been now? Fuuuuuuuuck.

Recent separation from MetLife has created increases operating and hedging expenses but a lot of that should go down over the next 6-18 months. Basically just costs a lot of money to recreate all the operating and hedging stuff under a new company. The company is new but the business is old and undervalued by any and every metric. It's not a sure thing they turn it around this quarter and long-term growth is doubtful but the assets they hold are currently worth 25% more than the current stock price so there is limited downside risk.

About Echelon Corporation

“For 30 years Echelon ($ELON) has pioneered the development of open-standard networking platforms for connecting, monitoring and controlling devices in commercial and industrial applications. With more than 140 million connected devices installed worldwide, Echelon's solutions host a range of applications enabling customers to reduce energy and operational costs, improve safety and comfort, and create efficiencies through optimizing physical systems. Echelon is focusing today on two IoT (Internet of Things) market areas: creating smart cities and smart campuses through connected outdoor lighting systems, and enabling device makers to bring connected products to market faster via a range of IoT-optimized embedded systems”


So they have all these fancy smart systems that win awards and shit. Really cool stuff. 

Now is 4Q they made some nice moves, 

 — A major city in New England selected Echelon's IoT-enabled, connected streetlight system to intelligently control 5,150 LED streetlights in the downtown district. Together with the potential for sizable energy and maintenance savings, Echelon was chosen for its proven ability to control and manage the city's lighting infrastructure through a combination of wireless connections for conventional light fixtures, and power line communication for decorative lighting fixtures. This system is currently being installed.

   -- The City of Rancho Cucamonga in southern California selected Echelon as part of their LED streetlight retrofit project. Not only will the city have fine-grained control over its streetlights and automated monitoring and reporting for the first time, they also estimate that the retrofit will save over $1.0 million a year from lower energy use as well as maintenance savings. This project is also currently being installed.

   -- A major city in Silicon Valley selected Echelon's lighting controls for 5,749 LED street lights. Echelon was chosen for its ability to control and manage the city's lighting infrastructure and being ""Smart City"" enabled to support future IoT applications. This project is currently being installed. 

They are growing rapidly in an emerging space, now you must trust in $ELON because as a WSB member you should have at least 1 $ELON in your back pocket.  


Imagine going up to that pretty bitch at the bar, 

“hey you know, I work close with $Elon” “Really!? Omg how cool” 
“Yeah I provide him advice on how to run the company”
 “wow so you’re like smart and have money”
“Yup, now lets hop in my 98  Nissan Altima and head back to my place”
“Umm, why do you drive that?”
“Because I’m smart, I bought a reliable car. No car payment means I can put my money to work for me, like buying spy ITM puts”
“Take me now you autistic genius!”


Like that’s the power that comes with owning $ELON now the average volume for this company is 16k .. I’ll let that sink in.. yesterday was under 3k.. so we might create a demand for the stock, buy low sell high right? 

By the way, they report earnings today after market close, even the slightest beat with demand can take this company to the moon. you’re move WSB.

Sorry I'm late! This week's predictions/forecasts are below.

[**Excel sheet**](https://imgur.com/a/sDmCyCr)

Reddit's table formatting is fucking atrocious. I don't have an hour to dick around with it, so you guys are getting a screencap this time (variances for identical predictions and forecasts are due to rounding).

**EXPLANATIONS:**

* Methodology: Avg.  of last 6 months actual results * [1 + (YoY simple growth rate / 12)] -- simplistic, sure, but probably still better than the non-farm forecasters.

* Source: [worldeconomiccalendar.com](http://worldeconomiccalendar.com/)

* I'm only planning to do forecasts for the reports that have a ""three bull"" rating. I also **WILL NOT** forecast crude oil inventories because it's a fucking pain in the ass. If you can't live without a forecast for crude oil, just look at what happened over the last few weeks, count how many times it beat v. missed, and expect the trend to follow whichever there's more of (although you should also consider things like weather, prices at the pumps, and so on).

* ""Red,"" ""Boring,"" ""Green,"" are just for fun. I try to base them on real information, but don't get it twisted: THEY'RE GUESSES. If anything, I'm hoping people will take them as a springboard for discussion, since we really do need more real-talk.

    Red = bad

    ~~Boring = $SPY closes within $1 of its opening price~~ [NOTE: For the next 2-3 weeks, I'm going to try either ""red"" or ""green"" guesses and see how things pan out.]

    Green = /u/MrTrader1's mom's dick

**WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT WEEK?**

5/14/18: Green (despite new talk about potential sanctions on ""Europe,"" RE: Iran, the markets shouldn't react as poorly as they did when the whole China thing came up)

5/15/18: Green

5/16/18: Green

5/17/18: Green

5/18/18: Green

Guesses will be revised if/when news requires it. I don't factor Trump into my initial set, but as the week wears on, I do account for his dumbass shenanigans in my commentary and make revisions if needed. Earnings reports don't get factored-in, either way, because I don't have the time to go so in-depth. Finally, no revisions after midnight or on days where my guesses are correct.

Barring any major earnings disappointments, trade war surprises, or Bolton shaving his moustache, this week just doesn't have much going on.

**Current record:** 11 correct / 20 total

$ES - S&amp;P500 Futures Intraday 
 https://i.imgur.com/Xz8sqSr.png

   A bearish looking setup though I'm not 100% convinced it will play out.  10 point range before you can tell for sure if you're wrong or right so choose your entries carefully.

  Best case scenario we trade down towards a target of $2754 area before the market opens however if we can hold price around last close, I would still be looking to short any rallies up against $2832 area . Above $2842 intraday setup is no longer valid.  

  $VIX  - Volatility Index https://i.imgur.com/0rZ2Fir.png

Showing signs of bottoming which can hopefully bring volatility back to around 19's or higher in august.

  $CL Crude Futures  https://i.imgur.com/meJN9pL.png

Crude is trying its best to stay above this strong resistance at $69.38 that spans back to 2007-2009-2010.  Longer term is setting up for a reversal but still has room up to $71-75 if we can start to see closes above $69.38.  If that holds you can use that as a point to buy but its in the middle of a huge range so stay probably best to see if this area can hold before making any serious commitment.


$AMZN Amazon https://i.imgur.com/ETDGDao.png

Last week was its chance for continuation north of $1900's but since it failed to close at highs, its setup is more tilted towards a reversal in the coming week.  $1863 looks to be hard resistance so if it fades there, you'll have your confirmation.

$TSLA - Tesla https://i.imgur.com/sde4gz1.png

  Don't trade this.  $TSLA will find a way to fuck you regardless if you're long or short. If you're already short $278 is a very reasonable place to take some profit. GL

$FB - Facebook https://i.imgur.com/Em1d8ok.png

  Facebook showing a relatively reliable topping pattern but again, range is wide and we're right in the middle.  I'd be looking to fade rallies up to $195 rather than buying dips here.



  TLDR.  Markets are starting to show that weakness is a likely possibility come August,  Bullish continuation signs are fading but not completely out of the picture.  Room to make money  long or short but safer to sell rallies than to buy dips until more clarity.  If the market fails to break out and goes sideways long enough it can easily kill any big selloff next month.  Let me know any stocks you'd  like me to look at and I will try my best to post what I see.

The ETF's geographic objective is Global with a focus on Communications Sector, Broad/Multi Cap companies.""

For you poorfags who can't afford $GOOG or $FB, this bitch gives you a good amount of exposure to both. Top 10 holdings of the ETF are: FB (21%) GOOG+GOOGL (25% collectively) ATVI (4.5%) DIS (4.5%) VZ (4.5%) EA (4.5%) CMCSA (4.5%) T (4.29%) CHTR (4.095). They also have a stake in NFLX, (3.93%, which I like) and TWTR (2.78% which I don't like).

As I'm long AMZN and NFLX, I like the fact that I get exposure to FB and GOOG in a more affordable and more diversified fashion.  I also think having some of the traditional telecomm dividend cash cows in this shit is good.  Sure, T is tanking right now but they're dividend is solid and stuff to provide a little bit of stability.

0,4277,I met Elon Musk yesterday,"I met Elon at a restaurant yesterday - we’d accidentally been given his table. Apparently he was fond of the restaurant and had a specific table he liked, and the management had messed up and gotten their days wrong, (it was Sunday and they thought he was coming on Monday or something like that).


Anyway, the manager, completely embarrassed (this is a pretty nice restaurant) comes by and says “I’m so sorry, but we’d like to move you to another table if you could be troubled, and we’ll gladly compensate you for the cost of the meal and any other meal you’d like while you’re in the city.” My sister and cousin were both like “Yeah that’s cool.” and I kind of played the asshole a bit. “I’m sorry, I just don’t understand. We’ve been here for 15 minutes - we’ve just ordered. Can’t we finish our meal here?”


Then out of nowhere Elon shows up next to the manager and says “Steve, these guys can finish. We’ll be at the bar. I got some time.” And I (being a big ol' Musky fan) said “Oh wow, uh… I had no idea. Please feel free to give them the table.” Elon was grateful, shook my hand and said thanks, then gave me a card with his number on it and told me to give him a call later for some free $MU. After working up the nerve, I gave him a call that night, and to make a long story short, we had a glorious 11 month love affair, man on man, that I shall never forget. Our bodies intertwined as one, and from the beauty of Morocco, to the French Riviera, to the snorkelling in the Galapagos, Elon and I made glorious love to each other on six of the seven continents.",2018-07-23 07:27:23,['MU']

0,4279,The wrestlemania of tech earnings ends next week... so where do we go from here? $MU,"Listen, I like you guys &amp; I know alot of you fello autists have failed with MU by buying at ATH near earnings and getting buttfucked. 
--------------------------------------------------------

If you are one of these guys who plays FDs on earnings and hate MU because of the mouthfucking it provided you...what you need to know is that, what you are doing with $MU is all wrong because earnings is a massive sell off... And in all honesty its the dumbest thing for it to drop, we all agree on this... AMD barely gets its shit together and its already close to hitting $20... MU has millions for buy back, knows revenue/EPS out the park. Sets a great tone for guidance. its such a perfect stock in so many ways. And its not cyclical like alot of bitch ass analyists have said in the past(maybe true a few years ago)... Why do I think they are wrong now? Because there is a computer boom occurring right now as we get closer to living in a world similar to blade runner. In all different fronts and not just personal computers is this stock booming. 

Places like cloud data centers (you know that thing that pushes Amazon and Microsoft to the stratosphere each quarter), AI, IoT technologies, phones, you name it, if it has storage, it has MU and friends.

--------------------------------------------------------

So how do you play MU? RUN UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't believe me? Look at the last two earning's, month before ER, run up... BOTH times this hoe as gone up from ~$50 to $60 (Last one was $64!). It doesn't have negative shit out (aside from china possibly which I will speak more on). ITs already going up, I am done with the wrestle-mania of tech and switching over to MU.Good luck to apple and the rest that still got a go but I need more assurance and space than just a week before ER.

So CHINAAAAAAA. Yes, its playing retarded right now and trying to steal MU's patients to copy. And Trump is about to throw in 500 billion dollar tariffs on this country. Both should make you uncomfortable. But now unlike 2 weeks ago, US is not alone on this. EU this week said that they will work with the US and try to get China to play honest. If china is smart, they would try to fold like the commies in EU did. Or else they are about to get hit with tariffs they cant directly counter attack... China dont even have 500 billion tariffs to counter. How they plan to retaliate is still to open to debate (target US companies in china, tackle American debt they are owed, etc). But with pressure coming from all the major countries in the world... It will be interesting to see what happens.

I am actually closing all positions as an options only trader since these past few weeks is the moeny maker for me. Don't need to buy/hold much and risk another correction(We had a nutty tech run where we hit ATHs)... But I will buy/hold for MU which is $10 away from ATH.


--------------------------------------------------------

WIth all this said... we may get a rocky journey to MU's ER but its more bullish than bearish. BUT since you autism isn't fully charged to utter stupidity. I hope you only buy a Sept 21 Calls at $57.5(or $55 if your a pussy) for 1/3 of the amount you want to invest and add more with each dip.

Earnings is on Sept 19.

Make sure to SELL before earnings! Buy an FD with your gains with a portion if you think it will do an AMD but dont risk everything on the earnings. Play the game of no IV &amp; have no risk of the unheard dare I say... possible shitty MU earnings.

US top 4 carrier capex is growing at 13% and hyper scale capex is growing 29% in 2018.

In addition, the current campus switching refresh that CSCO has undergone provides better than normal support for Cisco’s enterprise business. The company is expected to deliver significant returns to shareholders from the tax laws, and has already announced a $25b increase to share repurchase authorization, and hiked its dividend payout ratio to nearly 50%.

In fact, INFN three month implied volatility of 52% is 13 points below three month realized volatile.

**Overview:**

Aveo Pharmaceuticals (Aveo Oncology, for some reason they have one name for their company and one for their website) is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing targeted treatments for oncology and other unmet medical needs.  The company has a flagship product tivozanib, a compound that not only provides a long half-life, but servers as an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor 1, 2, and 3 receptors as a treatment for renal cell carcinoma and other types of cancers.  With several partnerships in the works, the company is leveraging their position to develop and commercialize their pipeline which already has traction in Europe.

The CEO, Michael Bailey, has been with Aveo for eight years originally coming in as the company’s chief commercial officer, then served as chief business officer in 2013.  In 2015, Bailey took the position of chief executive officer and president of the company.  Prior to being at Aveo, Bailey worked at executive level positions at Synta, ImClone Systems (now Eli Lilly), and SmithKline Beecham, where he helped market and commercialize drugs such as ERBITUX, CYRAMZA, and necitumumab.  With more than 20 years of experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry and experience in commercializing drugs in the oncology space, Bailey brings a solid track record to the table to help advance the company he runs. 

Aveo Pharmaceuticals has 6 different candidates in their pipeline with a total of 10 combined indications of use.  This robust pipeline is headed by their flagship product, Tivozanib.  With three different indications, tivozanib has been approved in Europe as a first line treatment in patients with RCC (renal cell carcinoma) as well as for adult patients who are vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease progression after one treatment with cytokine therapy for advanced RCC.


**Pipeline:**

With their six different products boasting a total of 10 different indications combined, Aveo shows great promise.  Their lead candidate is tivozanib, which has 3 current indications of which 1 is already approved in the EU since August 2017.  With an already proven treatment and potential for more, it is hard not to get excited about the potential with tivozanib.  The remainder of the company’s pipeline is still very early stage of the development process ranging from Preclinical to Phase III.  They have two different sectors that they break their products down into, Oncology and Non-Oncology.

**Oncology**

Tivozanib:

*TIVO-1 – 1st Line RCC (Approved)

*TIVO-3 – US Phase III Registration Study in 3rd Line RCC (Phase III)

*TiNivo – +Opdivo RCC (Phase II)


Ficlatuzumab:

*SCCHN (Investigator) (Phase II)

*Pancreatic (Investigator) (Phase I)

*AML (Investigator) (Phase I)


AV-203:

*Esophageal Cancer (Phase 1)


**Non-Oncology**

Ocular Form:

*AMD (Preclinical)

AV-308:

*Cachexia (Preclinical)

AV-353

*PAH (Preclinical)


While they do have a robust and outstanding pipeline, we want to turn our focus towards tivozanib as they will be presenting Phase II data at the ESMO this coming October.  This data is representing the TiNivo trial of tivozanib and nivolumab (Opdivo) in aRCC, as an immune checkpoint, PD-1, inhibitor.


**Specific Drug:**

Tivozanib is an oral, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which is approved for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC in the EU.  This potent inhibitor features a long half life which is selective of all three VEGF receptors and is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities.  This essentially makes the compound more efficient and potentially less toxic while requiring minimal dose modifications.   In the US, tivozanib is being investigated in a Phase II trial in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Opdivo (nivolumab) in RCC.  Tivozanib’s distinct tolerability among VEGF TKI’s creates a unique situation where it is a prime candidate to use alongside PD-1 inhibitors.  

The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway plays a significant role in angiogenesis, which is critical in cancer. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is essential for endothelial cell proliferation, migration and survival. There are five known VEGF ligands (A, B, C, D, PLGF) and three VEGF receptors (1, 2 and 3). Each ligand exhibits distinct but overlapping binding profiles for the three VEGF receptors.


To optimally inhibit the VEGF pathway, it may be critical to effectively block all three VEGF receptors as each plays an important role in cancer angiogenesis:

VEGF receptor 1 is critical for the modulation of endothelial cell survival and vessel morphogenesis;

VEGF receptor 2 is thought to be the predominant receptor for endothelial cell proliferation and migration; and,

VEGF receptor 3 promotes endothelial sprouting and vascular network formation.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated tivozanib is a potent, selective, long half-life inhibitor of all three VEGF receptors that is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities.


With that overview done on the drug, lets dive a little deeper into this.

TKIs have recently revolutionized the treatment of RCC while inhibitors of VEGF pathways have become the standard treatment option for patients with RCC.  Tivozanib is a novel VEGF receptor TKI inhibitor which has demonstrated antitumor efficacy.  The unique selectivity of tivozanib has shown minimal off-target toxicities and prevented many adverse effects.  Also, VEGFR TKIs have shown modulation of antitumor immunity, providing synergy between VEGFR and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibition, showing tivozanib to enhance PD-1 activity through regulatory T-cell reduction.  

When tivozanib was compared to competitors axitinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, and sunitinib, only tivozanib and sunitinib significantly reduced the percentage of regulatory T cells.  Where P = % CD4/CD25/FoxP3 (all regulatory T Cells analyzed by flow cytometry), the drugs produced the following results 16 hours after last TKI application.

Tivozanib – P = 0.034

Axitinib – P=0.908

Pazopanib – P=0.354

Sorafenib – P=0.427

Sunitinib – P=0.002


As you can see, only tivozanib and sunitinib showed a significant reduction in regulator T cells.  However, due to the specify of tivozanib, its unique adverse effect profile makes it an ideal candidate for combination therapies.

The Phase II study of TiNivo is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerable dose of tivozanib in combination with nivolumab in patients with RCC.  All patients are over 18 that present RCC, which is a measurable disease, and have no prior exposure to tivozanib or nivolumab with a life expectancy greater than 3 months.  Patients of the study received tivozanib QD for 21 days, followed by a rest period of 7 days, and nivolumab intravenously 240 mg Q2W.  Dose of tivozanib included 1.0 mg QD and 1.5 mg QD.   Phase II was an expansion of cohorts of maximum tolerated dose enrolled patients to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of tivozanib. 

In Phase I, no patients experienced dose limiting toxicity in cycle 1 (4 weeks) and MTD was determined to be full-dose tivozanib 1.5mg/d + nivolumab 240 mg.  In Phase II, an additional 21 patients were enrolled at MTD on top of the Phase I 6 patients.  In Phase II, a total of 6 patients discontinued tivozanib and 7 discontinued nivolumab, and there was 1 dose reduction for tivozanib (cycle 6 or 24 weeks in) and a total of 17 dose interruptions. 

For safety, 14 (51.9%) of patients experienced 1 or more grade 3 or 4 adverse effect of any cause.  Nearly half of the adverse effects that were experienced could have potentially been immune-related adverse effects rather than an adverse effect of the compound itself.  These include rash, pruritus, increased ALT, increased amylase, increased AST, increase lipase, sarcoidosis, and diarrhea.  The most common adverse effect was hypertension, but the mean age for patients was 63. 

Preliminary Antineoplastic Activity and preliminary efficacy was assessed in 14 patients who started therapy at MTD and had 2 or more treatment scans, being on treatment for 4 months or greater.  Of the 14, 11 are undergoing treatment including 3 in cycle 8 with a partial response.  The results showed that of the 14 patients, none had seen a complete response, 9 (64.3%) saw a partial response, and 5 (35.7%) showed stable disease with no progression.  No patients displayed progressive disease.  The charts indicate that patients who have been treated for 24 or more weeks almost all saw some partial response, giving the potential that extended treatment will generate a response.  

Although preliminary, the results of the data indicated before a 64% response rate and a 100% disease control rate in patients receiving the MTD suggesting promising antitumor efficacy.  This data demonstrates efficacy for tivozanib in combination with PD-1 inhibitors.  The updated Phase II data to be presented in October of 2018 will hopefully affirm these numbers and show greater response rates and no disease progression in all patients. 


**Current Market:**

RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, accounting for 90-95% of malignant neoplasms involving the kidneys.  It is estimated that over 63,000 cases of new kidney cancer will occur in the United States and over 14,000 individuals will die because of it.  According to Grand View Research, the global kidney cancer drug market was valued at $4.4 billion in 2016, and expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.4%.  Incidence of RCC is highest in North America and Western Europe.  Globally, there are an estimated 270,000 new cases diagnosed each year and over 116,000 deaths because of RCC.

While previously the treatment for kidney cancer was simply removing the kidney, various forms of treatment methods have been implemented among the currently approved drugs, including immune modulation therapy, cytokine therapy, mTOR inhibitor, and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitor.

Rising preference for novel immunotherapies and immune-oncologic agents will push the use of targeted therapies to specific patient subpopulations or later lines of treatment. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors are poised to displace TKIs and mTOR inhibitors as the standard of care in first-and second-line RCC settings. Combination regimens, specifically those including PD-1 inhibitors will be introduced in the first-line setting to target major unmet needs, giving Aveo a prime opportunity to grab a large share of the market treatment.

Competition in the space includes major companies such as; Amgen/Allergan, Argos Therapeutics, AstraZeneca, Aveo Pharmaceuticals, Bayer, Exelixis, Incyte, Merck, and Roche.

PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors represent a paradigm shift in kidney cancer treatment. Several PD-1 and PD-L1 agents with novel therapies are in early development and are being evaluated both as monotherapy and in combination with already approved immuno-oncology agents.  Again, another position that Aveo has an opportunity to shine in.


**Financials:**

Recently, Aveo ended Q2 2018 with $18.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated a total revenue of $0.4 million, the same revenue amount generated the same quarter last year.  Expenses have gone down in R&amp;D and administrative combined.  With a net income of $4.0 million for Q2 2018, the company posted an income of $0.03 per basic share and a loss of -$0.06 per diluted share, which compares to a -$0.30 loss per basic share Q2 2017.  Approximately $11.1 million of Q2 2018 net income was due to the decrease in value of the 2016 warrants which resulted from the decrease in stock price in the quarter.  The company believes that the $18.1 million will fund operations into the first quarter of 2019.  With a market cap of just under $400 million, this small company is going to look to raise funds soon to continue funding their trials, resulting in an upcoming dilution.  


**Review:**

I like this company a lot.  They have a drug in a large, unmet market that is developing and going to grow fairly rapidly.  With an already approved indication and several more products in their pipeline, I believe they will see success.  The data in Phase I showed promise and building off the safety and efficacy of Phase II I believe the additional cohorts put in will bring about positive data in favor of the drug showing specificity and low toxicity.  Having already demonstrated not a single progression in disease, it is unlikely we will see progression moving forward, and we will start to see partial responses from more patients.  

I do expect a dilution in the coming two months, however they did just gain value from the warrant situation, creating an opportunity for the company to take advantage and present a dilution to raise funds to continue operations for the next year or two.  Their burn rate is pretty high but that should be assumed due to their pipeline and stages of development.  The stock has been trading up the past 2 months, almost doubling its low since July.  Although, I have no issue buying below $3.50 for a long term hold.


#**TLDR**

This stock has rocketed up, almost doubling since a low in July, but really just getting back up to support zones around $3.  I think under $3.50 is a buy, they need to dilute to raise cash soon so expect an offering, but with warrants expiring from 2016 and freeing up a bunch of debt the company is in a good spot to do an offering.  I dont see a short term play here, but I do see a long term hold of 1+ year for a solid gain if you are looking for a small company, big bet to add to your portfolio.

0,4385,$NIO will be worthless in a few years (1 - 3),"I expect the stock to rally high on the hopes of all the people that could't get on the $TSLA train, just to see their dreams crushed. I will feed myself with those crushed dreams by converting them into tendies.


This the roadmap of this company:

- NIO, the Tesla Killer!!!

- NIO, stock prises rises, electric cars have a new player

- NIO makes a demonstration of future cars, they have more cameras and sensors than Tesla

- NIO granted a loan to build a factory to make said cars

- NIO moved 2 tons of dirt, getting ready for manufacturing 

- NIO expects deliveries in two years, 2021

- NIO key executives leave company for an actual car manufacturer

- NIO struggles to get the cars into customer hands

- NIO can't produce the cars, more difficult than expected, need more money

- NIO doesn't get the necessary funding, halting the production

- NIO files for bankruptcy. 


There is this false premise or illusion that startups have, it's called ""I can make electric cars because they are easier to make than gasoline"". Yes, an electric motor is much easier to manufacture and assemble into a chassis, but there is a lot more to cars than that, the unforeseen enemy of this short sighted entrepreneurs is scale. This startups think that they can be a massive manufacturer just because they can make one prototype. You can make the prototype as cool and fast as you want, that says nothing about your ability to manage a fleet of thousands of cars and customers. 


The only ones that are able to pull this off until now as a new player is Tesla, and that will be the case for a long time. The reason, is that Tesla focuses on what matters: delivering the product. You can see this thought manifest in the way they update the cars, releasing hardware features over time, how they started with roadster which was barely holding together, their customer service improvements, ability to fix cars... 


NIO, Lucid Motors, Faraday Future... all make the same mistake: make a car with unreasonable amount of features, gimmicks, sensors, futuristic dreams and designs... removing focus from what matters. It's very easy to detect this types of companies just by looking at their website and philosophy.


They try to beat Tesla in 0 to 60 times with a stripped out prototype and charge faster than a Tesla by swapping batteries or some 300Kwh cable that can't be used... when instead they should be bragging about their ability to deliver, fix, update and assist cars and talk about battery resilience in adverse conditions.


- When you enter NIO website the first thing you see is a futuristic prototype that will never exist, waisting they resources just to fool some gullible investors. Mercedes can waist their time into this, NIO fucking not. Tesla does not and it doesn't have this type of crap.

- They have battery swapping. This is a management hell, costly to install and implement, it's absurd on all levels and no one is going to buy this car because it takes 5 minutes instead of 30 minutes, the reason is that most people charge at home. You can just short any company that offers swapping.


They also must start by doing a niche product, catered to a specific audience. Tesla started with expensive roadster for example. The only company I see doing this is Porsche, which targets luxury and build quality which are two features where Tesla lacks.

0,4410,$EVBG is a great buy right now.,"I've posted about $SSTI a lot in here. I think $EVBG is a great compliment to them, and right now their valuation looks a lot more appealing. I love $SSTI and I am holding a core position long term, but I've trimmed a lot between $55 and $60. They are pretty expensive now when comparing their ev/sales to other high growth software companies.

$EVBG, however, is much more attractive. I believe it has a lot of upside that we can see in the next few months. They have a lot of long term contracts which helps reduce long term risk. They have strong, accelerating revenue growth and they are being smart in their efforts to balance growth vs their path towards profitability. They are currently trading at around 12.5x ev/2018 sales. IMO they warrant at least 16x, implying an upside of \~28%, or \~$74 per share (trades around $58 now). 16x ev/2018 sales would be much more in line with what we see in other small cap/high growth tech companies.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts on the Nike upcoming earnings report. First off, call is on 9/25 after close, I'm getting 9/28 calls tomorrow.

Nike is up about 10% since last quarter (May: $71 - Aug: $78). Kaepernick ad increased sales by like 30% I believe and now this report just came out: [https://www.foxbusiness.com/retail/nikes-number-of-sold-out-products-spiked-after-kaepernick-ad-report](https://www.foxbusiness.com/retail/nikes-number-of-sold-out-products-spiked-after-kaepernick-ad-report)

 \- Alot of sold-out Nike products basically

We won't see those this ER but the news will probably drive it up even more.

Nike has beat their last 4 ER's and the stock has popped on the last one big May's ER: Stock jumped $8 after ER!

This quarter runs from May - Aug. Here's where I think it may beat even more. 

This year was the World Cup- largest sporting event in the world. Even bigger than that, Nike sponsored 10 teams (Adidas sponsored 12) and out of those 10 teams, 3/4 were in the top 4 teams and France (Nike) won this WC. Perhaps there was more revenue as Nike sponsored national teams grew closer to the finals and after France won! In addition, Nike sponsored Nigeria and saw a record breaking jersey preorder of 3 million Nigerian official jerseys. Nike also sponsored more individual player's boots with 60% of the top 200 players being sponsored (including Neymar, Ronaldo and Kane). Finally, Nike has outperformed Adidas stock in 4/5 past world cups, I expect them to do the same this year.

Nike's EPS (0.62) is lower than the past few ER's by a few cents, even given the WC additional revenue. It has beaten 6/6 of the past ER's and I expect it will do the same this time.

\&gt; What's everyones thoughts? I'm gonna grab a few $85 calls and $88 - 9/28 at open tomorrow, especially with todays dip I think this will be good. Hoping to see another $6-10 jump after earnings.

Goodluck everyone!

[Last earnings I made bank](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8zwxw3/betting_the_farm_against_pm_tomorrow_morning) on the morning dip. The ER was fucking terrible, the only thing that saved them is their dividend increase because this is nothing but an old man, Roth IRA, /r/finance divided stock.

[When I booty called my hubby the ER before that](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8acvzq/guys_in_an_hour_or_so_im_going_to_be_on_a_certain) he saved me from a 20% drop.

So let's get into some facts about this shit hole ~~country~~ company.

Cigarette sales are down and down and down again. Marlboro is their bread and butter and it's flat at best. The US has a hard on against cigarette companies, and when [people see this kind of article they attack them even more.](https://health.ucsd.edu/news/releases/Pages/2018-10-10-Lung-Cancer-Deaths-are-28-Percent-Lower-in-California.aspx)

They are betting the farm on their IQOS smokeless device. It's biggest sales are in Japan (fucking 67%) and there are reports that [the Japan sales are slowing for no reason](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/10/10/philip-morris-getting-burned-by-slow-iqos-sales.aspx)

If you read their last earnings call all they talk about it the IQOS and how it's going to save the company. They are [waiting on FDA approval for the IQOS in the USA ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-international-tries-risky-move-making-cigarettes-extinct-181322924.html) and they won't get it. 

JUUL has dominated the US market and its now [coming under extreme scrutiny from the FDA](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/02/health/fda-juul-e-cigarette-surprise-inspection-bn/index.html). This does not bode well for $PM getting the go ahead they want for their IQOS, which as they say themselves, is all they have left.

They are going to guide down again and if they lower the dividend they're fucked. They're up over 8% the past month for no reason, and if you're a TA fag you can see them hit the ~$86 resistance yesterday and it's falling today.

This stock is going to dip to ~$76 the morning of. Sell immediately because old fucks like to BTFD, especially during this tech selloff cause they think $PM is a safe haven.

Okay, so I have managed to lose 80% + of my portfolio twice this year since using options (before I was up nearly 50% off just stocks)

Yes, I realize I’m a special kind of stupid, got greedy and shouldn’t have BoUgHt CaLls At AtHs DuRiNg a TrAdE WaR and proceed to watch my account bleed. In all seriousness should I continue gambling with this money and just continue adding to my TD Ameritrade account? Or should I just take the $500 (probably much less tomorrow) and put it in stocks. I’m currently  bagholding V $150 11/16 calls and MSFT $115 10/26, 11/16, and $125 Jan calls. 

I’m 20 and have lost nearly 3k being an idiot. I’m putting back $400 each month in TD. I make around $1650 each month after contributing 10% to my ira/401k. The remaining money goes to bills and some is spent on stupid shit I want. 

Also my first dip to -80% was $iq Chinese meme calls . Then I took the $500 or so into $iq puts, made some cash money, lost some cash money and made it up to $2800 with MSFT, V, AMD, and others. Then I bought $GE puts, made some cash, but didn’t expect it to recover next day, held and sold. Then I caught the knife Thursday doubling down on my MSFT and V calls. 

I am incredibly sad that I have lost so much at 20 in a bull market where you can make 20%+ returns in etfs, but you haven’t lived until you open your account and see nothing there. ",2018-10-10 17:28:15,['GE']

And in order to maintain the same level of equity literally 1 day later, I needed the price to up to $221 for no gain. More than a whole point change. Usually Theta of around -14 to -18 keeps things consistent for the week, never seen such wild fluctuations in a single day. The price stayed the same and I lost $300..... even considering the time decay and volatility of the nature of options, this is wild.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like there is a some very convoluted calculation in the backend algorithm for RH options where they scalp or skimp off some extra theta for locked in profits on their end.

Back to Flower One, they have the largest green house in Nevada at 400,000 sq. Ft with a 55,000sq.ft production facility, making it rival the top 5 cannabis corporations (CGC,Aurora etc.) The main difference is they are targeting 140,000 lbs of production once canopied starting Q1 of 2019. 

Nevada has a population of 3 million with an annual tourism topping 43million. Las Vegas will certainly have an insane demand and Flower One is poised to have a monopoly on the state.

0,4531,$WIN: Near pure arbitrage play for poor people who have patience . . . and want to make it rain,"If any of you fags can muster up some patience, there is a rare arbitrage opportunity in shares of $WIN, which is the result of some pricing disparities in the newly released Jan. 2021 options, combined with a very acute, and unexpected spike in implied volatility. The convergence of these 2 factors is allowing for some pretty ridiculous risk-reward profiles using a long collar strategy on $WIN shares.  

I opened the 2 positions below earlier today, and they are about as close as you can get to a pure arbitrage (i.e., completely risk-free) trade. To open a position, you buy the underlying $WIN shares, along with a Jan.21 option collar with a $5/$7 spread (buy the $5 put, and sell the $7 call).  Looks like there will still be good opportunities tomorrow to open these positions. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Position 1****:**

BUY - 10,000 Shares @ 5.06

BUY - 100 WIN Jan.21 $5.00 Puts @ $2.82

SELL - 100 WIN Jan.21 $7.00 Calls @ $2.84

(Net Collar Cost = -0.02 Credit)

**Position 2:**

BUY - 10,000 Shares @ 5.04

BUY - 100 WIN Jan.21 $5.00 Puts @ $2.66

SELL - 100 WIN Jan.21 $7.00 Calls @ $2.51

(Net Collar Cost = 0.15 Debit)

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, these trades are possible due to unusual disparity in put/call option pricing on the Jan.21 LEAPs, which allows you to initiate the collar at little or no cost. The end result is a long trade with substantial upside, and little to no downside exposure.  Both of my positions have upside of almost $2 per share, while limiting my maximum losses to just $0.04 per share for my first position, and $0.19 per share for my second position.  Here are the full risk-reward profiles for the 2 positions I opened today.  If you are using a margin account like I am, this strategy is absolutely cash-money since it costs practically nothing to open the position, but even with a cash account, this is still a compelling play. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Risk-Return Profile (Margin Account):**

*Position 1:*

Margin Required = $400

Max Gain = $1.96 per share ($19,600)

Max Loss = $0.04 per share ($400)

% Investment Return, Max Scenario = 4,900% 

*Position 2:*

Margin Required = $1,900

Max Gain = $1.81 per share ($18,100)

Max Loss = $0.19 per share ($1,900)

% Investment Return, Max Scenario = 952% 

&amp;#x200B;

**Risk-Return Profile (Cash Account):**

*Position 1:*

Cash Required = $50,400

Max Gain = $1.96 per share ($19,600)

Max Loss = $0.04 per share ($400)

% Investment Return, Max Scenario = 39% 

*Position 2:*

Cash Required = $51,900

Max Gain = $1.81 per share ($18,100)

Max Loss = $0.19 per share ($1,900)

% Investment Return, Max Scenario = 35% 

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I’m not getting into any serious diligence here on $WIN as a company. $WIN is a struggling telecom provider in the midst of a turn-around effort that management believes will restore profitability and cash flow.  The company’s future is uncertain – it will either soar or sink in the next 3 years or so. Thanks to a successful debt restructuring earlier this year, the company’s near-term bond maturities have been pushed out to 2021, and the company’s cash flow is starting to improve. The key catalyst for the company will be the outcome of a litigation matter that went to trial this summer. It was a bond default dispute (Google it – there are a million articles). The decision could come out any day, and if $WIN prevails (as most people expect), then we’re going to see $WIN shares double (or more) almost immediately. If the company loses, it may have to explore bankruptcy options or a white-knight sale of the company’s assets. The outcome of this trial will dictate whether this trade pays off at the maximum level, or whether it’s a write-off. I’m ball-parking the odds of a favorable decision at 80%.

0,4564,The perfect short: $F (Ford),"I saw somebody on CNBC a few days ago call AMD ""the un-shortable stock"" and it got me wondering what is the ""un-longable stock""? 

The answer came to me as I walked past my Ford Fusion to my free rental car given to me by my local Ford dealership.

6 months ago I got a letter in the mail telling me that my car might try to kill me. My car, a Ford Fusion (yes, I know, I'm poor), has airbags in the passenger side that can kill you with metal shards if you crash. It said that Ford was required to give me a rental for free until they fix this airbag issue. I figured they would give me a rental for a few days and fix the car because it costs them $60 a day to borrow these cars from Enterprise. They don't even take your defective car, they just give you the rental for free and let you keep your car. They tell you not to drive it, but they don't take down your milage (so if you want, you can drive both cars). 

 6 months later I am still driving this free rental Sonata and Ford hasn't called me to tell me they'll replace the airbags or given me any kind of timeline. I asked Enterprise when they expect Ford to have the airbags and they said ""IDK man, every other car company that had this problem has gotten them fixed ASAP, but we've been handing out cars to Ford drivers since february and I haven't seen a single one get fixed. So I wouldn't expect to get your car fixed anytime soon."" 

What kind of POS car company can't fix an airbag in 6 months? These rentals are going to kill F earnings for the foreseeable future. Short this shit company ASAP. Look at their 5 year chart! It's HORRIBLE!

TL:DR short F because they are handing out free rentals for eternity to any customer with bad airbags (many thousands of customers).",2018-08-30 11:06:18,['F']

I believe that TSLA will rebound to at least $340 short term.
Alot of investors sold off their shares after the news of a SEC investigation then the sell off when TSLA announced they would stay private from the people who were expecting the share price to rise to $420. My theory is this is an overreaction.
There has been recent news that TSLA is trying to get there entire factory to use renewable energy via solar power and most likely the tesla powerwall. Upon looking at the last few quarters balance sheet it showed that one of the big expenses for Tesla is making and storing energy for the year the total is about 1M+. Assuming Tsla  follows through this expense can be eliminated or decrease alot whick would be more cash for tesla to hold on to.

0,4581,Something that no one is talking about for $TSLA," By pushing the common stock's price above the $360 level, his tweet has put a $900 million convert issue above its conversion price, which would effectively let the electric-auto maker pay off that obligation in stock instead of cash.

&amp;nbsp;


Tesla has a $920 million 0.25% convertible issue due Feb. 27, 2019, which would be convertible into common at a price of $359.8676 per share. If the stock trades below that price at the conversion price, the holder would be better off taking cash. That would put pressure on Tesla while it continues to burn cash, as of the second quarter. But by being able to redeem the debt in stock would obviate the obligation to come up with over $900 million in cash.

0,4585,So you listened to me and bought $SNAP puts before earnings...,"This stock is dropping past hell.Earth's fucking core.At least, it should. That's what you wanted to hear. But the market will be irrational far longer than I am ever able to be solvent. I took some time yesterday to shit on snap about 4-5 hours before earnings dropped. And basically the stock ended the after hours session basically flat, with a (negative) You and revenue beat (of a respectable $11 mil) as the only buffers between SNAP and the very depths of hell.But I listened to the call, and aside from the ""victory"" of not losing as much money as the market thought SNAP was supposed to lose, things look bleak for SNAP. Real fucking bleak.The call was a collection of avoidance and attempts to gloss things with a baseless optimism. They basically refused to speak on DAU, and have discontinued its use as a metric that they give guidance on. If you dive into their presentation from the call, DAU dropped by 3 million down to 188. Snap tried to spin that in YOY terms, but social media isn't seasonal, you're trying to make little snap addicts, and even though snaps kept hyping how for a company this young having so many users is a big deal it's a much bigger deal that the users are dropping so early in their life.But what about revenue? Well most of SNAPs rev comes from ad rev. And most of that exposure to the ads is driven by a little button on the bottom right of the screen, the ""Discover Section"". An analyst who likely actually has used the app before had the good sense to ask how many people waste their time on that side of the app. (It's utter trash, I never use it, but maybe I'm just an old fag) Snap wouldn't say. They also wouldn't talk about clickthrough rates or ad engagement metrics. If I'm a company trying to sell an advertising platform (which at its core is their primary business model) why TF would I not brag up and down about ad engagement metrics and use them as a part of presentations on business performance and objectives for future growth?? Only reason not to bring them up is because the metrics fucking succ and would deter further advertising.And since privacy is important for users: the Indian guy on the call kept talking about all the different types of consumers they can identify, so it's very important to be able to trust snap won't have massive data leaks. they claimed that user should trust them for privacy, in light of the fact that they can’t even keep their own damn source code private. How can you trust a company that can't keep its own damn secret sauce a secret?And to go to a completely different area, news hit yesterday that some fucking Prince bought a lot of snap. So what? But even if it did mater, the accumulation was completed in May.And then finally, the big point that matters most, this trash company is still not cash flow positive. Back in 2012 when Facebook IPOed, Facebook had already turned a profit before, and grand total since IPO Facebook has had only 2 quarters with negative EPS, its first two. (-0.08 And -0.02). SNAP HAS BEEN NEGATIVE EVERY QUARTER SINCE IPO AND THEIR GUIDANCE FOR NEXT QUARTER DOESNT SHOW A FUCKING PROFIT EITHER.I am not the only person with a bullshit marketing and finance degree. Go listen to the call. That is a sinking ship. If you aren't short, get short.If you already are short, #metoo. Way to take initiative. If you're holding faggie D's RIP. While I want this to fall today or tomorrow, very likely that it just trades sideways on the earnings ""beat"" (hard to call a non profitable company with no signs of future profit a winner). I wouldn't be surprised if we see max pain on Friday at close, then start the selloff next week. Personally I am holding my Puts for at minimum a week. And I'll likely re evaluate the environment later next week once the earnings players have vacated the trading floor. If it hits $14 I'm not selling, unless it holds at 14 for a couple days and a support level gets found. If it goes sub 13 I'm holding on for more glory unless theta starts to fuck my profits.

Dell is a bitch ass cheapo. I used to work for a contract Repair depot that repair shits for Dell. Dell pay out $25 for each laptop repaired and do you know how much Dell charge for the warranty? 3 yrs is at least $300! 

Its a fucking blood money. Those repair and test tech work like Chinese slaves because the only way to turn a profit from Dell's peanut pay out is by volume. 

Dell get to keep $300 in 3 yrs if you didn't use the warranty and they will use every excuses in the play book to tell you to go fuck yourself.

Just wanna get a few of your opinions. This year has looked a different then the past few years with this whole market trending down lately. But with UPS $3-4 drop today I got a few January 18, 2019 $115 calls with break-even at like $117. This will require a 6.3% increase from its current position to hit that. With Amazon, Walmart and other retailers stepping up their online store offerings, this may be a great year for shipping companies. I'm looking at UPS over FDX and others because of the pattern I see in their stock.

Make the beer and tendies combo great again,"Boston Beer $SAM has risen an average of 12% (low 6%, high 18%) in the 30 days before the last four earning reports, even off of previous downtrends. The industry has also been relatively unaffected by tariffs, because why would it be. Although sales were stagnant during 2017, revenue in 2018 has been reportedly exceptional. So much so that one of their main concerns is decreased profit margins due to having to outsource volume production to third parties, but they're undergoing expansions to keep up with the increasing demand. There seems to be optimism all around. I personally don't own any at the moment, but I'm definitely signing on if it breaks the previous ATH wave of previous pre-earnings before October 1st-ish. 

I can also personally assure the continued demand from the most fiscally irresponsible sector of the population isn't going anywhere soon (Source: College student). 

TL;DR: Ride the wave before earnings on October 25, especially if it breaks the resistance at ~$325. I personally wouldn't risk going in to earnings (I'll probably dump after 6-8% rise if I sign on October 1st-ish), but do what your alcoholic gut tells you to.

You guys seemed to like my analysis so decided to share this, a bit more tech focused, but I thought it was something you guys might like with your obsession with $MU and all

u/imspartacus811 and I did a great job digging up some information to narrow down what this new memory might be and then collating it into a nice video that follows along with the numerous slides referenced. 

# [Watch Here](https://youtu.be/WqzevlhygKk)

Major talking points include: 

* [TIMESTAMP - 2:19](https://youtu.be/WqzevlhygKk?t=2m19s) - Micron confirmed to be shipping new custom persistent memory to hyperscale company. 

* From [their earnings call](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/9i30bz/micron_q4_earnings_analysis_nand_dram_roadmap), ""For example, in Q4’FY19 (Q3’CY18), we started shipping a new custom persistent memory solution to a large hyperscale company.""

* [TIMESTAMP - 3:46](https://youtu.be/WqzevlhygKk?t=3m46s) - This new custom persistent memory would not be [one of the DRAM- &amp; NAND-based JEDEC standards](http://www.memcon.com/pdfs/proceedings2015/MKT103_JEDEC.pdf) or else they would've publicly shared the variety of standard used. 

* NVDIMM-N (DRAM w/Flash Backup, power loss)
* NVDIMM-F (Flash, block addressable) 
* NVDIMM-P (""Best of Both Worlds"", both DRAM &amp; Flash addressable)

* [TIMESTAMP - 5:47](https://youtu.be/WqzevlhygKk?t=5m47s) - It appears that only Micron can supply this new custom persistent memory and other competitors like SK Hynix or Samsung and unable to do so. 

* At the level of a hyperscale company, supply chain diversity is critical as these companies cannot afford to halt their business operations due to issues procuring parts. 

* If other suppliers could supply this tech, then customers would generally prefer to have a backup supplier, but that doesn't seem to be the case. 

* This kind of thing is somewhat rare. We saw it with Micron being the sole supplier of GDDR5X in the Pascal graphics cards and Samsung supplying certain kinds of exotic HBM (e.g. 8-stack, etc) until SK Hynix could ramp up their efforts. 

* [TIMESTAMP - 8:30](https://youtu.be/WqzevlhygKk?t=8m30s) - Micron has publicly talked about new memory technologies in [past roadmaps](https://imgur.com/a/3pi8woH). 

* New Memory A - Volatile, so it cannot be the new custom persistent memory. Probably cancelled since we haven’t seen a new volatile memory tech since DRAM.

* New Memory B - Probably 3D XPoint, since it closely matches a 3D XPoint slide (https://i.imgur.com/7ru77aS.png vs. prior slide). This cannot be the new custom persistent memory because Micron is skipping 3D XPoint Gen1 and they are sampling 3D XPoint Gen2 in late CY 2019. 

* [TIMESTAMP - 10:18](https://youtu.be/WqzevlhygKk?t=10m18s) - In later roadmaps, 3D XPoint is mentioned separately alongside a “New Emerging Memory” (https://youtu.be/61oZhHwBrh8?t=20m45s, https://i.imgur.com/lKvJbv8.png, https://i.imgur.com/Y7VAsTo.png). 

* The new custom persistent memory could be “New Emerging Memory”. 

[TIMESTAMP - 13:16](https://youtu.be/WqzevlhygKk?t=13m16s) - [Nantero NRAM](https://fuse.wikichip.org/news/1656/nanteros-nram-a-universal-memory-candidate/) might be one possible candidate for this new custom persistent memory. 

* NRAM is a persistent memory technology that has been originally developed by Lockheed Martin and used in aerospace (notably the Hubble Telescope). 

* Nantero took over the technology to move it into less exotic applications. 

* Fujitsu and maybe Samsung are already licensing the technology. 

* Micron could be among those licensees.

0,4706,$KURA - Kura Oncology DD,"#**$KURA – Kura Oncology**

**Overview:

Kura Oncology was created in 2007 and is based in California.  The company is utilizing the genomic revolution to transform how cancer is treated, understanding that a patient’s response to treatment depends partially on the cancer’s genetic makeup.  With an advancing pipeline of precision medicines for the treatment of both solid tumors and blood cancers, their small-molecule candidates specifically target signaling pathways and other drivers of cancers where there is a strong scientific and clinical rationale to improve the outcomes by identifying patients most likely to benefit from treatment. 

The CEO of the company is well versed in the biotech industry as he is not only CEO of Kura, but also a member of the board of directors for Puma Biotechnology, Zosano Pharma, as well as president and CEO of Wellspring Biosciences, Araxes Pharma, and Avidity Biosciences.  Along with his history in the biotech industry, his management, advisory, and leadership teams are all stacked with extensive experience.  While the resume is quite impressive, it does strike concern in me that this man is a member of several executive boards as well as CEO and president of several different companies.  I believe a pharma company that is pushing multiple candidates in their pipeline through Phase I and II studies should not have his attention diverted between 5+ different companies.  

Anyways, the company has three primary focuses for their development.  Precision Medicines, Targeted Therapeutics, and Biomarkers.  Utilizing precision medicine, they want to discover and develop innovative therapies designed to inhibit abnormally functioning cellular pathways that drive cancer growth.  These two categories will be paired with molecular diagnostics to identify biomarkers specific to tumors to better decide which patients will likely respond to treatments. 

**Pipeline:**

The company currently has 3 different candidates within its pipeline, with their flagship product being Tipifarnib.  This oral, investigational drug candidate is currently being evaluated in multiple Phase II clinical trials for four different indications.


Tipifarnib – Farnesyl Transferase Inhibitor

KO-947 – ERK Inhibitor

KO-539 – Menin-MLL Inhibitor


Tipifarnib is the most advanced drug in their pipeline, the furthest developed at Phase II while the others are in Phase I and preclinical.  We will discuss Tipifarnib below.  
KO-947 is being evalued in Phase I, and operates by blocking the activity of the enzyme extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which is a critical component of signaling pathways that has been implicated in various cancer processes, including survival, growth, and proliferation of tumor cells.  Phase I clinical trials are being conducted on patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic, relapsed, and/or refractory non-hematological malignancies.  Below is a poster presentation of the studies and function of this drug candidate.  

https://kuraoncology.com/wp-content/uploads/Burrows-AACR-2018.pdf

KO-539 is being evaluated in preclinical testing for treatment of specific types of leukemia.  Functioning by blocking the interaction of two proteins, menin and MLL that together, are critically important for survival, growth, and proliferation of certain kinds of leukemia cells.  Below is a poster presentation of the research being conducted on this candidate. 

https://kuraoncology.com/wp-content/uploads/2017-AACR-NCI-EORTC-Menin-Formatted-Poster-2017-10-18.pdf


**Specific Drug:**

While Kura has a relatively new pipeline, their main candidate is Tipifarnib.  This flagship product is being studied for four different indications at the company, however we are focused on one specifically.  For the indication of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas (HNSCC), this mid October the company is going to be presenting updated data from their Phase II study at the European Society for Medical Oncology.  In conjunction with that presentation, the company plans on initiating a pivotal trial in Phase III in the second half of 2018, which could very well land right around their presentation, providing a great opportunity for price action moving upwards.

Tipifarnib, an oral drug that functions by blocking the activity of an enzyme called farnesyl transferase.  Protein farnesylation is a key signaling process implicated in various cancer processes, including survival, growth, and proliferation of tumor cells.  With more than 5,000 oncology patients having been studied on the drug and observed to have manageable side effects, it is suggested that tipifarnib has the potential to provide benefits to specific cancer patients with limited treatment options. 

For the specific indication and use in patients with Head and Neck Cancers, the company is evaluating tipifarnib in patients that carry HRAS mutations.  HRAS is a proto-oncogene, a gene that has the potential to cause cancer, that when mutations occur or there is an increased expression, can cause this normal gene to become cancerous.  Proto-oncogenes code for proteins that help regulate cell growth and differentiation, and HRAS is mutated or expressed in certain head or neck squamous cell carcinoma tumors.  HRAS has been known for over 40 years, yet there are no targeted therapies for tumors with the mutated form of HRAS.  The company hopes that its product tipifarnib will selectively inhibit farnesyltransferase, a critical enzyme for the activity in HRAS.  The relapsed or refractory HNSCC patient population has a survival rate of six to eight months and existing therapeutic options only produce a response rate of 10 to 20 percent. For this reason, HRAS is often called an undruggable oncogene.  

HRAS mutations are observed in 5% of HNSCC cases, generating a direct need that has no products to fill.  Early research shows that tipifarnib induces deep, sustained regression in HRAS mutations.  Clinical proof -of-concept has been achieved in HRAS mutated HNSCC cases with durable responses being observed.  So farm, Kura’s research is demonstrating that HRAS is a targetable mutation in HNSCC and illustrates that there is potential for tipifarnib in the treatment of additional HRAS-mutant squamous cell carcinomas.  
So far, preliminary Phase II data which will be updated soon demonstrates many positive points.  Tipifarnib demonstrates an overall response rate of 83% in its patients and is not only generally well tolerated, but also shows a benefit in use.  HRAS mutant HNSCC patients saw no benefit from prior therapies including chemotherapy, cetuximab, and immunotherapy, however patients had responded well or provided a partial response when treated with tipifarnib.  This data is displaying that the mutant HRAS oncogenes are targetable as well as providing evidence that tipifarnib is effective for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC carrying HRAS mutations.  This was confirmed in 5 of 6 HNSCC patients and did so with rapid responses where other treatments had failed to provide any response.  

Here is a poster presenting the data, research, and more of the indication of tipifarnib in HNSCC.

**Market Outlook and Competition:**

This market looks like it will continue to grow higher in the foreseeable future.  Driven mainly by alcohol and tobacco abuse, it is expected that the global head and neck cancer market will grow at an astounding CAGR of 22.6% from 2018 to 2023.  This would push the market to reach $2.3 billion by the end of that growth period.  The World Health Organization estimates that there are more than 550,000 cases and nearly 300,000 deaths worldwide each year.  Roughly 90% of head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, creating the sixth leading cancer by occurrence.  An estimated 63,000 Americans developing head and neck cancer annually, and 13,000 dying of this disease. In Europe, there were approximately 250,000 cases of cancer registered and 63,500 deaths in 2012.  Looking back at our numbers earlier, roughly 5% of these cases are due to HRAS mutations, the precise market that Kura is targeting and has no current, successful treatment option. 

Drugs approved for head and neck cancer include Abitrexate (Methotrexate), Blenoxane (Bleomycin), Bleomycin, Cetuximab, Docetaxel, Erbitux (Cetuximab), Folex (Methotrexate), Folex PFS (Methotrexate), Hydrea (Hydroxyurea), Hydroxyurea, Keytruda (Pembrolizumab), Methotrexate, Methotrexate LPF (Methotrexate), Mexate (Methotrexate), Mexate-AQ (Methotrexate), Nivolumab, Opdivo (Nivolumab), Pembrolizumab, Taxotere (Docetaxel). Drug combinations used in head and neck cancer include TPF – Docetaxel (Taxotere), Cisplatin (Platinol), and Fluorouracil. Drugs in the phase III clinical pipeline for SCCHN include Avelumab, Durvalumab, Gilotrif/Giotrif (afatinib), Multikine (leukocyte interleukin), Tremelimumab, and Yervoy (ipilimumab). The immune checkpoint inhibitors (durvalumab, tremelimumab, ipilimumab and avelumab) are expected to obtain approval by 2021.  However, none of these products are specifically targeting HRAS mutations.

**Finances:**

The company recently underwent a public offering of common stock on July 2, 2018 in which the company sold an aggregate of 4,600,000 shares of common stock at a price of $16.75 per share. Net proceeds from the public offering, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, were approximately $74.5 million.  This Q2 2018, the company posted R&amp;D expenses of $11.5 million, more than double that of Q2 2017 and a 50% increase in administrative expenses.  The net los for the quarter was $14.7 million, or $0.45 per share, again more than double the loss of last year, but only a $0.05 loss per share due mostly to the dilution which occurred this past July.  
Kura does have cash and cash equivalents which total $200.4 million due to the raise in capital form the offering, which will allow the company to have enough cash to fund current operations through 2021.  Thankfully for investors, this means that they do not plan on diluting any time soon.  I would however likely expect a dilution in about a year, around the same time they did this year just to keep the cash on hand at a high level.


**Review:**

This company looks promising.  This product has a decently sized market that is expected to grow at over 20% for the next 5 years.  That is an astounding number that provides a great opportunity for Kura to fill an unmet need.  The stock has been trading between $14 and $24 through 2018, and is settled right now at a good support level of $16.75.  It has traded down this past month after posting an earnings loss and following the dilution, however I see a turn around coming.  

With the high amount of cash on hand and updated data coming out as they present at the ESMO as well as initiating a Phase III study in coming weeks/months, you will see a pop in price here. This company might be a great long-term hold, as they are producing a product that will fill an unmet need, however success at the end of the road is not guaranteed.  Oncology drugs that pass Phase I have only shown a likelihood of approval of 5%, compared to an average of 12% for all other indications outside of oncology. 

Short term, Phase II data is really showing safety.  I see that survival rates for HNSCC are low, incident rates are high, and this drug is well tolerable.  I think Phase II will see success and going into Phase III you will see a price increase.  Results from Phase III however is a different story.  My play here would be a short to medium term investment for now.  Their flagship drug has 4 indications that seem to have high potential as well as two other candidates in their pipeline.  There will be activity over the next year and with the volatility and price range that this stock sees, I think anything around $16 would be a good buy as we will likely see $22 before the start of 2019.


#**TLDR**

Looks like a good buy under $17 for a swing play up to at least $20.  Long term iffy, oncology doesnt have a high rate of approval from the FDA, but there is an unmet market need this company fills.  With 3 drugs and 6 drug indications, they have potential to continue to rise.  Recently diluted shares, have cash to last 3 years, they should be a great buy here and hold for a few months to maybe a year.",2018-09-18 15:00:37,"['KURA', 'KURA']"

0,4727,Jim Cramer: Fear everywhere and how today is going to go; TL;DR: $AMZN to the moon,"""Jim Cramer: This Selloff Is Driven By Naked Fear"", 
""Fear. Pure naked fear. You can smell it. The fear emanates from those who have been buying stocks for the last couple of years who have never seen a selloff of this magnitude -- it's been six years since a tech selloff of this magnitude, so that makes sense when you think about it. The fear that emanates from fund managers who were up huge and gave back such huge gains yesterday that they almost have to sell at the opening to lock in their years. The fear that emanates from the fundamentalists who forgot what it was like to have pre-announcements and are now faced with a rash of them and therefore expect more. The fear of those Wall Street moneymen of the president, who has brought his angry but folksy rhetoric to their world -- not to the world of rabid fans around the country that are as far from New York as Mars. They see the crazy off-handed comments by a president that is quite different in tone and thought from Jerome Powell, and they wonder how Powell can get out of this box. You can't bend to the president without destroying the Fed's independence. So how does he walk back his comments that triggered the selloff. All of these camps are coalescing to bring out selling pressure that is far more than the ETFs, the corporate buybacks and the index fund buyers can handle. 

A concentrated burst of selling is the equivalent of a mini-crash to these buyers. They don't have time to even put their bids in. The broken way the market acted yesterday did feel like a flash crash, didn't it? Now we did have a selloff of incredibly swift and deep magnitude just nine months ago when the trade wars began. That was, in retrospect, a correct call to be worried about trade wars but an incorrect call in terms of what the market did. It ended up being driven by powerful VIX programs, fueled by thinly capitalized entities. This time we haven't figured out what instrument went haywire. We don't know if it is a bunch of growth funds that decided there was no price that wasn't too good to sell. Now, though, step back and ask if your whole screen should be red. This is day two of the selloff after a 10-to-1 down-to-up ratio of a day. The answer is, of course not. Today is the day that the index fund sellers and the European spillover sellers and the lock-her-up sellers meet buybacks, hedge funds that need to make money and companies in the non-economic world that are a sure thing. Today's the day when health care companies that have strong growth get bought. It's the day when the drug companies with decent yields slow down their decline and then reverse. Any food company with decent numbers stays the course. It's also the day when the industrials related to non-auto and non-housing tend to rally after the margin selling is over. Check back between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. ET. 

But then there is tech -- and we don't know tech. This tech selloff started with Facebook and then jumped to Micron Technology , and it has led to a scary concept: the slowing of the data center. How could it not be, you figure, if the stocks of Advanced Micro Devices , Micron and Nvidia have been hit so hard. But then again, that's the point. Some sectors bottom faster than others. However, as I have said over and over, you need the obituaries for FANG to be front page -- they are almost universally there. That's when you can buy. 

Last thought, Amazon : because this is the key to the market. If you want to watch one stock for tech to bounce it will be this one. But the selloff has to have an intraday retest from a bounce, and if it holds, then a second one. If we are past margin clerk hour -- meaning between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. -- and you get a bounce, it could still be a sucker's game. If you see it developing, you can pick, but wait to see if the selling machines are still going haywire at 2:45 p.m. If they are, well, go back to the first group, it will really start to shine."",",2018-10-11 09:21:09,['AMZN']

0,4741,Activision $ATVI will excel in Early 2019,"TLDR at bottom

Getting right to the obvious point here, ATVI is going to see a surplus of sales of their new upcoming Call of Duty game. This is mostly due to the new Battle Royale mode that is being added due to the popularity of other BR games such as Fortnite. Call of Duty sales have never been able to grow their new sales numbers, majority of consumers are loyalists. This is because its a dying franchise in terms of fan base and dwindling new player base. 

There was a DD I saw somewhere, LINK would be appreciated, that basically described what was mentioned above.

But heres the meat and the potatoes, ATVI will have a boost in stock from Q4 sales (i.e holiday shopping, game release date) but lets not forget when the earnings are released in 2019.

Also one last note, ATVI is Activison and Blizzard both companies make games that have a constant revenue system through the notion to unlock cosmestics by purchasing them which in sense equals $$$

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Buy ATVI now and hold until April/May 2019. We getting rich off Call of Duty y'all ",2018-10-02 11:05:16,['ATVI']
