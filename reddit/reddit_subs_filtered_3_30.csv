0,16,"Long $AMD, Massive Intel In-Hardware Security Bug Found (Hotfix Requires -30% Perf Penalty)","You faggots doubted SuBae, but her journey to the moon is undaunted by your cum-guzzling ways. 

Confirmed homosexual firm, $INTC, will be announcing [a massive in-hardware security bug in its modern processors that will require a **-30% performance penalty** to hotfix it](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7nl8r0/intel_bug_incoming/). This will notably affect large datacenter customers such as $GOOG and $AMZN (short them for maximum tendies). 

* As an in-hardware bug, this is not easy to fix and will require a brutal hotfix as a temporary measure. A less destructive fix will not be available until the hardware is replaced with updated models in the coming years (as if customers would choose to buy more $INTC products after this!). 

* The bug is currently under embargo much like $INTC is still officially in the closet. In the coming days, $INTC will publicly acknowledge its sexual orientation and the existence of this bug. 

* [$INTC's CEO sold off $11M of $INTC stock less than two weeks ago](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/12/19/intels-ceo-just-sold-a-lot-of-stock.aspx) and now holds the bare minimum number of shares required by the CEO according to $INTC by-laws. Looks like he's getting his yacht while he still can! 

* Competing processors made by SuBae are confirmed to not be affected by this vulnerability as their architecture is much girthier. 

This leaves **SuBae poised to fuck the competition up the ass** on large datacenter contracts. 

* $AMD has recently [ramped up production on their 32-core ""EPYC"" CPU](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12032/amd-announces-wider-epyc-availability-and-rocm-17-with-tensorflow-support) that competes in the datacenter market. 

* Not only does the 32C EPYC have more cores than $INTC's flaccid 28C CPU, but [EPYC costs half as much](https://www.anandtech.com/show/11544/intel-skylake-ep-vs-amd-epyc-7000-cpu-battle-of-the-decade/10). 

* SuBae is rumored to release an [EPYC 2.0 with an even more turgid 64-core CPU as early as 2019](https://hothardware.com/news/amd-epyc-2-64-cores-128-threads-and-256mb-l3-cache). 

 * Impotent traitor, [Raja Kodorki, is confirmed to not be involved with Epyc in any way](http://www.pcgamer.com/amd-radeon-boss-raja-koduri-joins-intel-to-work-on-integrated-and-discrete-graphics/) and will only be adding performance issues to $INTC products going forward. 

* SuBae won't rest until EPYC is packed deep into datacenters everywhere, leaving $INTC frustrated and on the streets to beg for tendies. 

I see **$AMD trading at $15 by weeks end**. It's yacht time, faggots. ",2018-01-02 19:18:07,"['AMD', 'INTC', 'GOOG', 'AMZN', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'AMD', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'AMD']"

Celgene has solid fundamentals and has been trading around the $100-$105 level since approximately mid October; which is down from the $130-$140 range it was trading at during that time. During this conference, they will be pre releasing earnings and guidance, which if even remotely positive, I believe will boost the stock in a positive fashion. In addition, Celgene is coming into support and has held its current levels very well. Subsequently, I took on a very small position ($1k) and am holding some of next week's 108 calls and some of the regular January expiry 107 calls. Logic may seem confusing, but shake and bake baby. Let me know what you jabronis think and if you are going to hop on the Celgene train for some quick and easy tendies.

TL;DR - Celgene may go up, down, or sideways on Monday. If you want to risk some money on an earnings play, this would not be your worst idea.

&gt;The iPhone has made Apple Inc. AAPL -0.07% and Wall Street hundreds of billions of dollars. Now some big shareholders are asking at what cost, in an unusual campaign to make the company more socially responsible.

&gt;A leading activist investor and a pension fund are saying the smartphone maker needs to respond to what some see as a growing public-health crisis of youth phone addiction.

&gt;Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, or Calstrs, which control about $2 billion of Apple shares, sent a letter to Apple on Saturday urging it to develop new software tools that would help parents control and limit phone use more easily and to study the impact of overuse on mental health.

&gt;Some have raised concerns about increased rates in teen depression and suicide and worry that phones are replacing old-fashioned human interaction.

I made a post on December 28th telling everyone to buy $MJX at $31 for a variety of reasons, but most of all because I knew there would be a lot of hype around it. But in the following days, the underlying stocks ran up way too fast. Because of the combination of fear from the Sessions announcement and the resulting weak volume, I've decided to reduce my position significantly and watch it for a couple weeks.

[The short-term chart looks reliably bearish from a technical perspective](https://imgur.com/TBpDUwO) and I expected the volatility to be a lot more muted than it turned out to be.

Back in 2016 after their first drug called Ocaliva was on the market, 19 people died, but those people were dying either way. PBC is a bitch. Doctors were giving bad doses, people were starting the meds sick as fuck already, and with better education between the company and the doctors, they'd have been fine. I imagine they've learned this. Basically, though, the drug wasn't what killed people. Nonetheless, investors freaked out and in September it dropped 50%. The company is still working on that PBC treatment but also, more importantly, a treatment for NASH. NASH is a currently untreatable liver disease that is common and growing across the globe, affecting 2%- 5% of the USA. 

So if you get in now, it's undervalued and set to go pretty high if their trials go well. This is probably a long to some extent but I believe it could be very good.",2018-01-11 23:42:28,['ICPT']

Even though it is undergoing a transition from consoles to digital platforms, the gaming industry has racked up some substantial gains in 2017. Stocks of major gaming companies have shown double- to triple-digit gains this year. Moreover, the exchange-traded fund (ETF) industry's first fund dedicated to gaming – the ETF Managers Trust Video Game Tech is up by approximately 50% in 2017.

Research firm Goldman Sachs, which recently began coverage of the sector, stated that video game publishers are ""in the middle of a renaissance."" According to a report released by consulting firm PricewaterhouseCooper (PwC), global revenue from video games is expected to hit $93.2 billion by 2019. The firm estimates that global distribution for digital games will reach $12.9 billion during the same time period.

Outlook:

	2018 is due to be a big year for Martin Marietta Materials. Following the passage of President Trump’s historic tax overhaul, the President’s persistence is now focused on pushing his infrastructure agenda through Capitol Hill. It is anticipated that President Trump’s infrastructure spending bill will reap numerous benefits for the U.S. Economy and U.S. firms that are leaders in the infrastructure repair and rebuild sector alike. In my opinion, President Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts bill overhaul, combined with mass infrastructure spending, will improve both GDP and consumer confidence.   
          The increase in GDP will be a ancillary result of an increase in government spending - due to the spending increase inherent in the Bill.  An increase in GDP will also, in turn, inspire consumer confidence as a byproduct, which is certain to encourage startups, manufacturing and inventory expansion, and overall growth in many sectors of the US economy. In addition, an increase in personal consumption attributed not only to government contracting in the private industry, but also to personal and business tax cuts, will give certain domestic industries that have been impacted by price/cost downward pressures, evidenced by the absolutely stagnant rate of inflation for the past 8 years, some breathing room on inventory and pricing increase.   
        One sector of these industries that will be positively impacted will be the aggregates and heavy materials building companies. Due to massive cutbacks in the DOT - employment went from 16k to 10k in 10 years - it is likely that the DOT will need to begin outsourcing differently, and will likely turn to the U.S. private sector to advance the pace of infrastructure work that the Trump Administration has prioritized for US cities and highways, infrastructure repairs, and rebuilds. It is my opinion that industry-leading basic materials firms like Vulcan Materials and Martin Marietta Materials will be well-positioned to garner the lion’s share of these contracts. The decision between the two companies will come down to competitive bidding, as well as to preexisting established relationships with the current Presidential Administration

$BTU largest coal operations firm in the World

Outlook:

	Earning call is February 7, 2018. -15.9% projected revenue growth provides evidence that $BTU will struggle to meet revenue estimates. $BTU is highly leveraged with a debt/equity ratio of over 2500%. Additionally $BTU has a negative return on equity ( -18.2%) and assets (-.09). $BTU’s trading and brokerage operations reported a revenue loss of -10.90M. $BTU’s projected 3 year revenue growth in its U.S. and Australian mining operations are -11.33% and -12.96%, respectively, which reflects a gross misallocation of resources. Under, “Other” operations, generating revenue of $19.10M in 2016, reported a projected 3 year revenue growth of -20.40%.

The competitive nature of Natural Gas prices pose a threat to coal consumption which could lead to a global oversupply. $BTU is an obvious short sale because all operations are based in primarily democratic states who can impose environmental regulation. 

Additionally, $BTU’s current stream of revenue, as well as future revenue growth, put to question whether or not $BTU faces a general opportunity cost: whether or not C02 allowances are worth their cost when considering revenue declines.

One should also take into consideration the current and forecasted decline in US coal consumption and exports. This may be attributed to an increased use in natural gas and recent cost reductions concerning renewable energy.

$BTU is an obvious short sale because all operations are based in primarily democratic states who can impose environmental regulation. Additionally, $BTU is one of the only firms which does not run operations out of the appalachians.

Also with the Chinese New Years is coming up and investors may want to lock in gains before the week long holidays. Back in 2016, Chinese markets faced something similar.

0,529,[DD] Cenovus Energy ($CVE),"*Disclaimer: I hold no position in CVE currently, but have in the past, and I haven't decided if I'll start a new position in the next few days before earnings


Cenovus Energy (CVE):

&gt; Cenovus Energy is a Canadian Integrated E&amp;P
&gt; company with 281kboepd of production (lt/med oil
&gt; 11%, oil sands 50%, other heavy 13%, natural gas
&gt; 26%) and 230kbpd of refining capacity. Most of
&gt; the company's production is from oil sands
&gt; projects (all of which are SAGD - Cenovus has no
&gt; oil sands mining projects), but it also has sizeable
&gt; conventional oil and gas developments. Projects
&gt; are developed in phases with repeatable
&gt; concepts/designs.

As energy/oil stocks have been hit harder than most during the past few weeks, Cenovus has fallen nearly 30% based on no new information other than systemic issues with the sector.

As the price of oil has declined the past week and change (~10% drop), $55-60 per barrel of WTI is near the bottom of the economical scale that makes sense for oil sands projects. 

CVE though has a solvent-aided process (SAP) technology that allows it to be near break even as low as $45 per barrell, far below what other competitors would live at. This technology though is *just* starting to be put into place and will take several months for a full roll out, but should allow CVE to be among the lowest cost oil sand producers out there.

In December, CVE released its [2018 guidance](http://www.cenovus.com/news/news-releases/2017/12-14-2017-cenovus-s-2018-budget-continues-focus-on-deleveraging.pdf) citing several cost savings:

(2018 budget vs. Nov. 1, 2017 guidance)

Per-barrel oil sands operating costs – down 8%

Per-barrel Deep Basin operating costs – down 11%

Per-barrel oil sands sustaining capital costs – down 12%

Christina Lake phase G go-forward capital efficiencies – a 21% improvement (vs. previous estimate)

Total oil sands production – up 26%

Now a major negative is that CVE has taken significant focus in deleveraging their balance sheet. To do this, they've had to sell off assets. Obviously this will lead to lower net income, but it also means lower debt payments and capex reductions, leading to high equity value. 

On Friday, a worker died at their Christina Lake facility as a drilling rig was being moved. Though this may have had an impact on the stock, it's hard to attribute as the stock continued its slide in the mass energy selloff. 

After releasing it's 2018 guidance in December, CVE gained ~30% before giving it all back due to the systemic energy selloff. 

CVE trades at a FY P/E of 9.6x and a 0.8x FY P/B. It also pays a $0.20 dividend, making a current dividend yield of 2.6%.

CVE has beaten earnings expectations for four straights quarters.

The consensus price target (per MarketBeat) is $15.10, with PT of:

BofA Merrill Lynch: $12.50 

CFRA: $13

Morningstar:$16

Using the lowest PT ($12.50) would represent ~65% return from the current price.

Snapchat loses money per user. Less users = less money lost = higher stock price.

The only way to make money on SNAP is to long.

Alternatively, we get millions of users to constantly send videos back and forth to each other 12-16 hours per day and watch the DailyMail story over and over, forcing them to lose more money. This would obviously need to be a large-scale operation and we can't do it between 3 of us faggots. But I don't have any confidence at all in organizing something of this scale so you'll probably all just lose money with your puts.

I decided to buy into this stock when it was at $6. It quickly grew and peaked (since my buying in) at $7.44 when the earnings report came out. 

They had a pretty rough earnings report and the stock price dropped as a result. However, I believe that this is the perfect opportunity to buy in while its low. 

Firstly, the stock has already started growing back yet again. Secondly, they recently became number one in residential solar in the U.S., passing Tesla's SolarCity. The past two quarters it has passed Tesla in residential sales.

It just announced its expansion into new states, which not only means growth compared to now, but also growth in the future as they continue to expand into more states. It is also good to remember that this was the winter quarter, and it makes perfect sense that solar companies wouldn't do too well in the winter, when the sun is barely out and you can't install in places such as the newly expanded Massachusetts since there is snow on the roofs. Now that we are moving into the spring and summer months, this is the time the company will experience a lot of people installing solar power. 

While Sunrun reported high net loss, they were lower than the previous year as well as almost doubling their net income and increasing their revenue by about $26 million. Since people reacted to the poor earnings report and didn't pay attention to the majority of good news coming out of this company, now is the perfect time to buy into the dip.  Its even been rated as undervalued, for example Credit Suisse set a price target of $15.

I'm running off 39 hours of no sleep and a lot of caffeine, nicotine, and adderall right now, so feel free to chime in about whatever in case I fucked up. And as always, buy $MU and $CRON

EDIT: Forgot to mention that Massachusetts is a meaningful market for them to expand their solar panel and battery business into since it is one of the states with the highest rate of power outages",2018-03-08 20:10:05,"['RUN', 'RUN', 'MU', 'CRON']"

0,929,Know what you're invested in - edition #1 JD.com,"Welcome to “Understand What you’re invest in” edition 1.0. These posts are intended to educate autistic traders about our most beloved category of assets, MEMESTOCK BOIS. This edition will cover one of my personal favorites, JD.com ($JD).


What:

 JD.com is an ecommerce sales company based in Beijing, China that deals in direct selling of consumer goods; JD does not have any brick and mortar sales locations nor does it manufacture any of its product offerings, all items are sourced from 3P manufacturers and distributors. JD also offers an online marketplace for vendors and consumers to host and purchase 3P merchandise. TLDR: JD is China’s “Amazon Lite” before Amazon developed web services and proprietary product lines.


Why:

 Two driving factors behind JDs potential for growth that we have all heard before; China’s middle-class is exploding and brick and mortar is dying. China’s urban household income is expected to double by 2022 (Mckinsey research). This will lead to a shift in total spending from the lower class to the middle and upper-middle class of Chinese households; meaning less of China’s total spending will be controlled by poors buying “needs” and more of China’s spending will be Alphas buying electronics, tailored clothing, household “Nice-to-haves” etc…


Let us look at the past 12 quarters’ revenue numbers to support this spending theory:


$5.9B


$7.4B


$7B


$8.5B


$8.3B


$9.9B


$9B


$11.6B


$11.1B


$13.6B


$12.6B


$16.7B


Estimates Q1 2018 15.6$ 


(B-b-b-ut Mr. fag trades, this is lower than last quarter!!! – holiday spending you dumb autist, this would be a 41.16% YOY growth for Q1.)


JD.com owns and operates 210 warehouses (~4 MILLION square meters) in China’s 50 biggest cities, as well as operating over 5,300 deliver and pickup stations. The distribution network is solidly established and DOES NOT include any storefront overhead.


Investor Snapshot: 
Market cap - $64B
Shares held by institutions – 55%
Short interest - 2.2%
30 day put/call ratio – 0.6
1 Year sales growth – 40%
5 Year sales growth – 54%
1 Year EPS growth – 104%
EPS growth forecast – 60.99% (1 year)


JD’s drop from all time highs resulted from a missed earnings in Q4 2017, where revenue actually BEAT. The miss can be attributed to JD reinvesting in itself:
“Despite posting better-than-expected revenue for the quarter, net income was down 17.7 percent at 449 million versus a mean analyst estimate of 666 million according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
In a call with analysts following the release of the results CFO Sidney Huang said smaller margins were linked to investments in new business lines including logistics investments, overseas expansion, artificial intelligence and cloud services.”


Reduced PPS also resulted from another $1B infusion from Tencent and a capital raise campaign of $1.9B open to Chinese banks and investment firms. 


Available ratings:


Market edge – long


Reuters Research – outperform


Morningstar – 3 stars


Concerns:


Alibaba competition


Potential to take on too much at once (international expansion, AI, web services, etc…)


Chinese economic downturn


Expensive by P/E standards


Disclaimer: OP Is looking for an entry for about $5K into LEAPS (2019/2020) but currently does not hold any JD. However, previous calls on JD have all been profitable so I am slightly biased.

Beyond my chimpish analysis of general market factors, the valuation looks stretched with no upside.

The only upside here might be benefits from reduced corporate rate and repatriation of cash effects. I looked into this briefly and found analyst estimates that 47.5b of the projected 54.5b is ""indefinitely reinvested in Oracle's foreign operations"", so there's not much of an upside there either.

In a set of internal memos, the heads of engineering and production at Tesla are trying to ramp up production for Model 3s to exceed 300 cars a day in order to show up the ""haters."" According to them, this would be a big win and make shorts regret betting against them. It does not confirm if they have even reached 300 models produced per day.

In reality, this confirms predictions that Tesla will miss promised production targets, again. Tesla promised to increase model production rates to 2500 cars per week.  With some simple math, assuming the factory operates 7 days week producing 300 cars per day, that's only 2100 per week. Tesla's promises to improve production have allowed them to secure more capital. This does not help their situation, as they are recalling the Model S. If they miss big again, lines or credit and access to capital markets will be limited.

While the stock has performed well YTD (EL +18.1% vs SPX +0.2%), GS analysis sees $EL as a high-quality name best-positioned within HPC. While Estee Lauder's relatively outside US exposure remains a drag on growth, its leadership position among Chinese consumers is proving an enviable strength today. While analysts expect the quarter to be a positive catalyst for shares, option investors are more worried. In fact, one month normalized skew is at its 81%-ile over the past year ahead of earnings.

Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL) on Wednesday reported fiscal third-quarter profit of $372 million.
On a per-share basis, the New York-based company said it had profit of 99 cents. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, came to $1.17 per share.
The results surpassed Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.07 per share.

The beauty products company posted revenue of $3.37 billion in the period, also exceeding Street forecasts. Nine analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $3.23 billion.
Estee Lauder expects full-year earnings in the range of $4.38 to $4.42 per share.

$EXEL just beat expectations of $0.13 EPS by 192%, $0.37. $EXEL is a biopharm company that is marketing a number of cancer drugs for various forms of cancer and they are applying for various expanded applications. The company has $0 debt with $500 million in cash. This ER puts their PE at 27 with a forward PE sitting at 14.33, but keep in mind, this is likely even low since they have been delivering solid beats with a very successful drug that has barely begun to penetrate the market of the various indications it has been approved for. This is the epitome of a perfect biopharm to invest in. A reasonable valuation, an effective and expensive drugs that has not saturated its potential user market, a robust pipeline, and a very cash positive balance sheet. And on top of that, I think its is just pretty fucking cool that this company is marketing two of the most effective cancer drugs (Cabozantinib, Cobimetinib, and XL888) which they discovered and developed all in-house. I think this really is a great company to invest in because they have a track record of discovering effective drugs for treating cancer and by backing them you are probably doing more to support cancer research than idiots running marathons.

INFN shares have realized an average move of +/-20% on their past 8 earnings reports. The straddle that likely captures this earnings report costs just 1% more than this historical average move. We believe this is a sign that option investors are overly complacent in shares and are not focused on the typical move realized on prior earnings reports. In fact, INFN three month implied volatility of 52% is 13 points below three month realized volatile. Earnings this quarter could be an important catalyst for shares considering shares have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 62% over the past 3 months and traded up 30% on last quarter’s earnings report (2/7).

Cost - $2.33

Possible 24% upside to Buy rated CSCO over the next 12 months. EPS estimate is 4% above consensus for the year, as then company’s end markets remain healthy and improving. US top 4 carrier capex is growing at 13% and hyper scale capex is growing 29% in 2018. This, coupled with a survey with the company’s CIO in December 2017, implies 3.4% growth in enterprise networking spending in 2018. In addition, the current campus switching refresh that CSCO has undergone provides better than normal support for Cisco’s enterprise business. The company is expected to deliver significant returns to shareholders from the tax laws, and has already announced a $25b increase to share repurchase authorization, and hiked its dividend payout ratio to nearly 50%. Options are pricing in a +/-4.3% move for earnings, in line with the median 8 quarter realized move. Never invest more than you are willing to lose, and always have downside protection.

+ Shopee is actually huge. They claim its the largest ecommerce platform but its definitely top-2. It's a C2C marketplace like Taobao and they are spending like crazy to grow the reach. On the surface it looks like ~ 650M of cash burn but Alibaba paid $4B for Lazada, they have similar reach as Lazada. Also 2-sided marketplaces have enormous operating leverage (same story as Etsy, etc).

0,1695,The eCommerce/fintech/small-biz-tech space generally is really heating up this year. $SQ $SHOP $PYPL,"Good morning!

Small timeline:

* Verifone (PAY) was acquired in early April.

* Square (SQ) acquires Weebly in late April (to round out itself in eCommerce, which was its weakness vs Shopify)

* PayPal acquires iZettle in May (to compete with SQ where they failed in the past with its homegrown product). iZettle was about to IPO with a 1.1bn valuation, PYPL pays 2.2bn for it. If this is overpaying, it signals a validation of SQ's business model, and that PYPL is giving up on their homegrown stuff (called PayPal Here).

* Square just yesterday issues $750 in convertible notes (I have a lot of speculation on this one, but something big is brewing)

* Adobe acquired Magento today (SHOP stock way down on the news)

Earlier, when Amazon mulled p2p payments (Square has Cash App, PYPL has Venmo), both stocks dip on the announcement, which was otherwise pretty hollow PR. Amazon actually had a Square/iZettle competitor called Amazon Register that they shut down back in 2015, so I would not be surprised if they want to get back into transaction spaces. Also wouldn't be surprised if they made a bid for SHOP or SQ within 2 years in order to get into eCommerce and small biz tech generally.

Both SQ and SHOP and PYPL have had nice years, stock price wise. But on the 52week SQ is up most of alll: 

**$SQ**: +169.2%

**$PYPL**: +63.3% 

**$SHOP**: +61.3% (this was higher until very recently)

**$PAY**: 28.7% - Even though its getting acquired, investors have barely made any money in the last year compared to the other three!

Disclosure: I'm watching this space very closely and am long SQ, AMZN. (edit: and now a very small call position in SHOP as of ten seconds ago, intended to be short term because of today's perceived overreaction. This is more of a bet than a position. I will not be long SHOP long term.)

2. Straddle $SPX, (I have proof and am in this now), We know there will be more drops and we know the market seems a little bullish as well, so capitalize on both ways.  Close the put when Market will crash from rate hikes coming and etc.. Add calls/puts day trading to the trend each day and close each day or next day 930am.. 

3. $TVIX, $VXX, $UVXY etc.  - We know there are rate hikes coming.  they are pretty low right now, if they drop more add to them each time they drop and build a position so when the Rate hike comes that we know is coming as soon as June! you can capitalize on it! 

4.  IF you know how to do things with Selliing calls/puts then let me know, as I don't quite understand that part to well yet but I did make $300 on Selling $VXX puts when we had that drop 2 days ago. But I'm sure there is many more ways then selling put spreads to do great things.. 

5. I will continue to Short the futures or play up the Nikkei futures because they make the most. 1 day holding overnight with 1 nikkei future made me this yesterday.

0,1737,Real DD: Buy $SIG - Moonbound 🚀,"This stock is super underpriced for several reasons. Huge margin of safety. Huge upside potential:

- SIG dropped over 10% since Q4 earnings, despite beating on both top and bottom lines.

- Hampered by ""death of retail"" thesis that was prevalent throughtout the markets 6 months ago

- Other factors that applied downward pressure (which will likely be mitigated going forward) include sexual harassment / discrimination litigation (imo a non-issue - filed by class of 250 female plaintiffs, a tiny portion of overall company employee base), and worries over deteriorating credit and an overly inflated A/R book (they're in midst of restructuring, and recently sold off a lot of their A/R at only a slight discount, so the credit fears are more than priced in, and in fact, oversold - that said, the restructuring does cause uncertainty)

- Large short interest (25% of float) led to downward pressure and squeeze potential

- Strong and grossly undervalued fundamentals: 5.7x P/E, 11.2 forward P/E (forward P/E assumes worst case scenario and is still cheap), trading under 1 price-to-book

- Little competition in the budget-priced jewelry space. If you disagree with the dearth of retail thesis, SIG should be fine. Further, jewelry shopping is an area of retail that will always be done more in-person than losing market share to online

- If you look at comps such as TIF (which, albeit is more in the ""luxury"" space than SIG), TIF crushed earnings and jumped 20% when most people thought jewelry was dead. TIF trades at 40x PE versus SIG's 6x. SIG earnings on June 6 - earnings could potentially be the catalyst that causes a correction

- Management bullish sentiment - increased dividend (4% yield), share buybacks, CEO bought about $350k of shares after the 11% drop in Q4 earnings

- General bullishness on retail in general... look at the recent runs of some really shitty stocks (I'm looking at you FOSL and DDS), retail has been on a tear after being undervalued for a long time (sidenote: I plan on shorting both FOSL and DDS at some point when I can find a good entry)

I could see this hitting 60-70 by year end assuming the concerns are alleviated and starts trading back above ""distressed"" levels. I've been following this stock a while. The last time this hit the 40s in 2017, it ended up in the 80s within 6 months (before crashing again due to earnings and credit concerns). The last time I gave a bullish call on retail, it was when Macy's was trading in the $18s, and it subsequently ran up 60% in the next 3 months, and is presently up almost 100%.

New TV\-series and merchandise for the younger ones and the parks for the housewifes who once dreamed to be a princess are the main income for DIS and the companys cash cows. The last earnings showed that the revenue from the parks are growing. Movies breaking records and milking of beloved franchises \(Star Wars\) continue to be the stars. As Cramer said no other company other then AAPL and DIS are capable of producing recordbreaking products EVERY year.

The Fox merger is about to pass. There is no chance Comcast will outbid Disney without going in deep depth. Disney is about to get the biggest part of Hulu who has 30 new series in the pipeline.

Next year Disney will launch their new streaming platform. Together with all the other income that Disney produces they have alot of power to produce new content. Netflix only has the streaming platform as main income to produce content. Disneys will beat Netflix in the long run.

Technical:

Disney moved  between 91 and 116 for a long time. Even with bigger market corrections the stock didn't go under 91. This shows that Disney is a stable company that won't go anywhere in near future.

If you want to make constant gains, try swingtrading the stock.

I personally recommend buying everytime the stock falls below 100 and holding it.

Downside:

DIS investors als old cucks who only care about ESPN. They do not understand the potential of the upcoming streaming service. ESPN is already priced in. The Moment DIS announces a major change to ESPN the stock will brake out. Also DIS might go for SKY and europe fags like myself watch alot of Football and pay for it..

My estimation:

DIS will start to raise beginning with the launch of the streaming platform and will reach $200 at the end of next year.

This was sometime in early November 2016, the day after $GNC tanked on a bad Earnings. I had been watching this stock for a few **days** and was certain that it would rebound so I purchased balls out the money calls with strike $16.50 a month out while the stock was ~$13.50. As soon as I purchased them I realized that the ask was now at the price i just paid and the bid was a few cents lower. Perfect time to average down. After buying again I noticed the same *phenomena* happened with the ask and bid so I averaged down again... and again...

Brothers this is the story of how I slowly walked down a low volume option’s price by taking out all the limit orders until there were no bidders left all in the course of 1 hour. I sold those calls the very next day to the first bidders for about 1cent per contract, a clean $4.4K loss my first day as a degenerate.

0,1936,Some DD oil plays,"A few months ago, oil was one of the hottest things on the street.  Analysts were jumping all over pretty much every part of the supply chain.  Some oil stocks were up a lot.  Some of my minor holdings, $BTE, $OXY, and $CHK were up 30%+.  

Oil has since made a serious pull back based on basically three sentences from Saudi oil minister suggesting that the Saudis and Russians might agree to increase output.  There are a ton of reasons this might or might not happen, but a lot of the fundamentals that led analysts to be so bullish on oil over the next two years are still there - but the prices are much lower.  

For the very weak - move some money out of your Ally account and go buy $VDE, $XOM, $BP, or $RDS.A.  There are about 10 other ""safe"" oil majors that could be decent plays in the next 2-5 years too.

For the bold - go buy $BTE, $APA, or $SDLP.  These are companies that can soar if prices simply stay where they are.  $BTE is a $1B company that has a book value of over $2.5B at current oil prices.  Even at $60 WTI, $BTE is worth ~$9 per share and is trading at $4.

For the WSBers - go buy options on the above.  Use your credit card advance.  Get OTMs with 6/15 expiry.

Prices are decent because of the pullback, but the potential is still there for ""tech-like"" gains on many of these.  Don't abandon tech to do this, because tech could still outpace oil.  But if you're looking to ""diversify"" it could be a solid alternative.",2018-06-06 15:04:56,"['BTE', 'OXY', 'CHK', 'VDE', 'XOM', 'BP', 'RDS', 'BTE', 'APA', 'SDLP', 'BTE', 'BTE']"

0,2019,Quick note for you guys trading $BRZU,"Some of you guys trading Brazil ETFs may have wondered why they were green yesterday, when Brazil is f'd.  

Well, nothing changed, Brazil is still f'd. The Bovespa index was down 1.23%, Petrobras was down over 3%. What happened was that, the night before, Brazil's central bank head announced that they'd use every tool at their disposal to stop currency devaluation, short of raising interest rates (a politically loaded issue). As a result BRL was up 6% against the USD yesterday, and suddenly Brazilian stocks became 6% more expensive for you gringos.  

Personally I think the relief will be short-lived. Back in the Dilma era the Brazilian central bank burned a ton of cash issuing swap contracts, with little effect. However note that this time they hinted they may pull out the big guns (Brazil is sitting on a 382 billion USD reserve). Also note that it works both ways, if (when, imo) BRL depreciation resumes, losses for USD-denominated Brazil ETFs will be amplified.  

Anyway, just my BRL 0.02. Don't trust me, just a (shithole) retail investor.",2018-06-09 18:23:49,['BRZU']

Kinder Morgan is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in North America. They own shitload of pipelines and terminals transporting natural gas, gasoline, crude oil, CO2 and more. Recently, the Canadian government stepped in and bought the transcanadian pipeline from KMI for $3.45B US dollars. The First Nation people have been haggling about this pipeline construction on their land which led to delays and increased costs. But the deal with canadian government should resolve this quicker. The way this deal is structured is that KMI will still own the pipeline when its up and running and the govt will only keep part of the profits. Official statement\-  “It’s not the intention of government of Canada to be a long term owner of project.""

Bull case\-

1. 4.75&amp;#37; dividends (will rise more next year)
2. Huge insider buying last quarter
3. Stock price at 2 year low; lot of room for run up
4. Transcanada pipeline sale eliminates regulatory and political risks
5. Owner and CEO work for $1/year salary

I figured this would make the IVs of the FDs explode, while the July monthlies would be somewhat elevated, but lower and more respective of the run-up the stock has had.  The IV chart [confirmed](https://i.imgur.com/XtXgXlT.png).

You know what this means!  Of course not, because you dipshits have no idea what you're doing with options trading.  Let me elaborate.

You can **sell** the FDs.  Yes, I know this is a foreign concept.  ""But then I have high/unlimited risk!  What if I get assigned!""  You can then cover the risk of selling these by buying the same strike in July.  [Here's an example](https://i.imgur.com/DGnKwb1.png).  I'd reference a link for calendar spreads for further information, but we all know it would be a waste of time.

If the short FDs expire worthless on Friday, you can liquidate your long options up to a maximum profit of around $80 per spread ($1600 in my example using 20 contracts per leg).  If the trade moves outside the break even points ($32.58 and $36.33 in my example), you can close out at about a $20 loss per spread.  Of course, you can always just manage the assignment (market sell the shares or maybe sell a covered call on them), and continue selling FDs with your long contracts as protection for the next few weeks.

0,2153,$IQ DD Inside,"I saw a post somewhere asking for some actual iQIYI DD so I figured I would do some for myself as well to give myself some piece of mind on this new meme stock.

For all intents and purposes, we will use Netflix as a comparison, though as it stands, iQIYI has more revenue streams than Netflix does. Since IQ closed around $40 today, I went ahead and looked for when NFLX was around $40 and made a comparison between what IQ has for Q1 18' and NFLX Q3 13'.

(everything in thousands except price or if there is a unit)

(everything converted to USD)

||IQ (Q1 18')|NFLX (Q3 13')||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Price|$19|$44||
|P/E Ratio|undefined|68.88||
|Total Revenue|$757,510 | $1,105,999 ||
|Net Income|$(61,617)|$31,822 ||
|Net Income/EPS|$(0.31)|$0.54||
|Total Assets|$3,561,079 |$4,901,325 ||
|Total Liabilities|$2,235,974 |$3,696,955 ||
|w/ Shareholder Def.|$3,561,309 |$4,901,325 ||
|Total Paid Subscribers|\&gt;50,000|31,092||
|Revenue Streaming|$325,374 |$884,134 ||
|Total Revenue|$757,811 |$1,105,999 ||

iQIYI has had some incredible growth YoY and even between quarters, there is an article here [talking about the user growth](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/27/iqiyi-growth-accelerates-in-its-first-quarter-as-a.aspx). The analysts there suspect growth to slow down in the range of 42&amp;#37; to 48&amp;#37;. I went ahead and did a safe growth of 35&amp;#37;. This would be for Q1 19' and resulted in some new numbers:

|Total Revenue|1,022,638|
|:-|:-|
|Total Assets|4,807,456|
|Total Liabilities|3,018,564|
|  w/ Shareholder Def.|4,807,767|
|Total Revenue|1,023,044|

These numbers are essentially NFLX at $44 so from the book standpoint, it is pretty safe to say IQ is CAN BE valued around $44 if their growth holds up. IQ's current stock price almost assumes that growth has gone up 35&amp;#37; since March rather than a full year of growth.

Realistically, the stock should be priced around $30-35, but this is understandable as to why it is trading higher than where its American brother Netflix was at a similar growth period because of their new AI competition, board changes, and user growth. NFLX was at \~$63 a share when they had 50 million subscribers, IQ already has that many subscribers and its growing, and even more free users. They also make about the same amount off advertising with their free users which is great news and have other revenue streams and continue to make new partnerships and release news between earnings. Knowing where there are in comparison to Netflix as a baseline is great because I know that anything below $35 is an immediate buy for me.

Enjoy the numbers, correct me if I am wrong anywhere. I know my total revenue is different than what articles have posted for total revenue (e.g $777M) but I converted RMB to USD from their balance sheet. Currently long $IQ and looking to pick up more if it ever goes below $35 x (some genius IQ premium multiplier).

Even through the mass sell off, it's up 4% today and + more in after hours. It came back from red to 4% up!!! Nothing bu MU pulls that off.

0,2361,Let's learn about currency risk ($IQ $BABA etc bagholders gather round),"Before we get started, I'm well aware that not all (or even necessarily most) of the losses seen in Chinese stocks over the last week are because of currency risk. That's not the point. The point here is that for the amount of ""discussion"" of Chinese stocks we see here ($IQ, $BABA, $JD just to name a few), there is essentially zero discussion of currency risk - one of the most significant risks of investing in a foreign stock.  
  
Now, don't reply with some faggy-ass comment about how the stock price is in US Dollars and therefore currency exchange rates don't matter - that's not how any of these works, and you'd be dead wrong.  
  

  
The components of currency exchange risk are often broken down into three categories:  
  
1) Translation exposure - We'll come back to and talk more about this one, it's important and not as intuitive the next one.  
  
2) Transaction exposure - actually exchanging money from one currency to another. You'd want a strong dollar when buying foreign currency (because $1 buys more foreigner money), and a weak dollar when buying US dollars with foreign currency (because $1 costs you less foreigner money). If you only use RH you don't need to worry much about this because you can only buy things in USD anyway. Big boys with better brokerages beware - you can have a stock that has a positive return in percentage, but a negative return after converting from it's currency to USD - but you likely already know that.  
  
3) Economic exposure - exposure to the economic conditions in a foreign country. We won't really talk about this because I'm not an economist, and if you can't understand that some countries have different economic conditions than others, explaining that wouldn't be worth my time.  
  
Now, if you have $IQ, $BABA, $JD, or [Insert favorite chinese meme stock here], you're probably thinking this is mostly irrelevant. Of course you're exposed to the economy of China, and I'm an idiot for thinking you didn't know that. You would be wrong, it's ""Translation exposure"" I think you fags don't know about.  
  
If any of you have done actual DD on any of these companies, you'll notice that their [financial statements show currency values in CNY rather than USD](https://imgur.com/a/jorgBxK). As the value of CNY changes relative to USD, the value of these assets to you (and income from the income statement) also changes.  
  
You may wonder why this is being posted right now. Since April 20th (a recent low point), the US dollar is [up around 4%](https://www.wsj.com/articles/yuans-2018-gain-disappears-as-dollar-rallies-1529892432) versus the Chinese Yuan. CNY is worth less versus the dollar, and therefore Chinese companies have a lower value in USD, even if nothing else changed.  
  
This is inevitable if the exchange rate changes, because they aren't going to keep USD instead of CNY as cash (wouldn't be efficient for them). Even though ADR's are denominated in US Dollars, the assets and cash flows they represent are denominated in foreign currency, so you can't just ignore exchange rates.  
  
You could hedge against this using forex futures to some extent, but if you didn't know about this before now, you probably don't have a large enough investment to do so.  
  
TL;DR: Even if you think exchange rate doesn't matter, it does. Don't be a lazy ass bitch, read the rest.",2018-06-25 17:15:06,"['IQ', 'BABA', 'IQ', 'BABA', 'JD', 'IQ', 'BABA', 'JD']"

Despite its triple digit revenue growth, investors were less than enamored with Uxin's (UXIN) IPO as the deal not only priced well below expectations, but, the company was also forced to slash the size of the deal. With Chinese stocks getting hammered recently - the Shanghai Composite is officially in a bear market now - UXIN was facing a major headwind in terms of negative sentiment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main concern is that an escalating and prolonged trade war could have a material impact on the Chinese economy, which would hurt an economically-sensitive business like car sales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for the IPO, UXIN cut the deal size to 25 million ADS (each ADS represents 3 ordinary shares) from 38.0 million, with the IPO pricing at $9 versus the $10.50-$12.50 expected price range. In all, the deal raised $225 million in gross proceeds, almost 50% less than it had anticipated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lead underwriters on the deal were JP Morgan, Cowen, Leerink Partners, and BMO Capital. Shares are set to open for trading later this morning on the Nasdaq.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overview&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UXIN is the largest used car e-commerce platform in China. Uxin makes it possible for consumers to buy cars from dealers, and for dealers to buy cars from other dealers and consumers, through an online and offline platform. The company says it has transformed used car commerce in China. Its platform allows sellers to reach a broad audience and ensures that users have access to an extensive nationwide selection of used cars. Its offline infrastructure allows Uxin to provide services such as inspection, title transfer and delivery of vehicles etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its platform consists of: 1) Uxin Used Car, its 2C business catering to consumer buyers. It provides consumers with customized car recommendations, financing, title transfer, delivery, insurance referral, warranty and other related services; and 2) Uxin Auction, its 2B business catering to business buyers. It helps businesses source vehicles, optimize their turnover and facilitate cross-regional transactions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uxin currently has a nationwide network of over 670 service centers across more than 270 cities that provides services at each step of the transaction cycle. This physical presence helps to cement its relationship with customers. Its title transfer service handles a potentially time-consuming and complex process for buyers. Its warranty program provides consumers with comprehensive after-sale protection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;China is the world's second largest automotive market and is forecasted to become the largest automotive market by 2023. There are approximately 185 mln car PARC (registered cars) in China, compared with 275 mln car PARC in the US. Despite the scale of China's car PARC, the low car ownership rate and a large population indicate significant room for continued growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Total used car transaction volume in China reached 12.4 mln in 2017. The ratio of China's used car sales to new car sales by volume was 0.5 in 2017, significantly lower than the 2.4 seen in the US. Used car transaction volume in China is expected to grow rapidly at a CAGR of 19% from 12.4 mln in 2017 to 29.6 mln by 2022.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking a quick look at the financials, the company is not yet profitable. Revenue in 2017 jumped 137% to US$298.6 mln. In 1Q18, revenue jumped 93% YoY to US$103.3 mln.",2018-06-27 09:57:45,['UXIN']

0,2519,$MU/UMC rundown,"This isn't as bad as they want you to think (Rosenblatt thinks it could be good for $MU).

Context: UMC was caught red handed facilitating the theft of Elpida (now owned by $MU) IP for China.  People were indicted, $MU filed lawsuits.

UMC filed a lawsuit to ""counter"" $MU's lawsuit and it's a big f'n joke; they're suing for $40-50MM USD saying $MU is infringing on their packaging IP, which should give you an idea of what $MU products are banned from sale in China - we're talking specific memory modules/packages, not all of MU's memory or product portfolio.

The provincial government for the court that made the ruling owns a major stake in UMC.

Any restriction of memory product supply to China is EXTREMELY bad for China.  Memory is still in short supply and artificially restricting the Chinese supply will drive up their prices.  Supply from the other companies would be rerouted from other parts of the world to China and then those customers that lost their supply would need to buy from Micron.  [The Rosenblatt analyst called into CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/07/03/is-micron-us-china-trade-war-stock-price-court-patent-united-microelectronics-tariffs-trump.html) and stated that $MU would love to be able to cancel their Chinese contracts and sell their memory at higher prices elsewhere.

I expect the US Government (hopefully the rest of the world) to hit back hard on this, low hanging fruit would be stomping ZTE out of existence.  Additional embargoes would decimate China's tech industry but it would obviously hurt the US economy as well.  This is a shot across the bow of all the worlds' companies that rely on IP and it will not be taken lightly.

I expect more panic selling and $MU to continue to drop.  Obviously, this is concerning but it's not hysterics-inducing.  DO NOT BUY NEAR TERM CALLS, Jan'19s at the earliest.  I'd recommend staying away until this gets properly sorted out - knowing $MU, it'll take much longer to recover than it should so there will be time to buy in when the proverbial storm clouds pass.",2018-07-03 15:46:35,"['MU', 'MU', 'MU', 'MU', 'MU', 'MU', 'MU', 'MU', 'MU', 'MU']"

0,2567,$57k Yolo Twitter buy based on the Washington Post report. Likely that their report that active user will decline isn't factual based on how twitter defines active user. Actual DD + proof inside,"Twitter ($TWTR) is falling because of a [Washington Post report that the company has been purging its user base of bot accounts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/07/06/twitter-is-sweeping-out-fake-accounts-like-never-before-putting-user-growth-risk)

&gt;Twitter has sharply escalated its battle against fake and suspicious accounts, suspending more than 1 million a day in recent months, a major shift to lessen the flow of disinformation on the platform, according to data obtained by The Washington Post.

&gt;The aggressive removal of unwanted accounts **may result in a rare decline in the number of monthly users in the second quarter, which ended last week**, according to a person familiar with the situation who was not authorized to speak. Twitter declined to comment on a possible decline in its user base.

So Wall Street is now pricing in a decline in MAU (Monthly active users) when Twitter reports results for Q2. MAU is the figure that Twitter provides in its earnings report, the company does not comment on ""total registered users"" which the company says is a useless figure.

---

It goes without saying that deleting fake accounts will not have an impact on profitability, but that is not the bet here.

I am betting on the possibility that the bot accounts being deleted were not being counted in the MAU figure in the first place. As an experiment, I created a test account last Friday when the WaPo report came out and purchased followers from a few shops that appeared when I googled ""buy twitter followers"".

All the followers that I bought ended up looking like this:

- https://twitter.com/AndreyaBosher
- https://twitter.com/EmbickNickol
- https://twitter.com/CurringtonMedha
- https://twitter.com/EdellSelvaggi

Twitter defines an ""active user"" as a user that signs into their account at least once per period. Thereby a ""Monthly active user"" is a user that signs into their account at least once per month. Twitter also reports daily active users (DAU). 

Now if you examine the few example of bot accounts that I just posted, you will see that they operate by following a predetermined number of people (in this case 125), and then they are forgotten and left there to sit. They do not post or exhibit any other kind of activity.

I am therefor drawing the conclusion that these ""fire and forget"" twitter bots create their account, blow their load and follow whoever they are instructed to follow, and then go away permanently. These types of accounts **should not be counted under twitter's definition of an active user**

0,2655,Shkreli's Portfolio Performance Since Going to Jail,"If you had copied Shkreli's portfolio from his last finance update video before he got his bail revoked in September 2017, you would have returned 16.72&amp;#37; on a gross exposure of 47.2&amp;#37; and a net exposure of 5.8&amp;#37;. This is without accounting for the borrowing costs attributable to his 15 short positions.

Portfolio positions were last shown in his ""This Week in Investing and Finance - Episode 21"" uploaded on September 10, just 3 days before his bail was revoked and he was sent to jail. Here is a photo of the positions being shown in said video: [https://imgur.com/a/37nLdbq](https://imgur.com/a/37nLdbq)

The secret short position was Axovant ($AXON), which he uploaded nearly 7 hours worth of videos on how to analyze a critical trial and his reasoning behind why it would fail its upcoming clinical trial. AXON ended up falling over 70&amp;#37; two weeks later after it failed its late-stage trial.

**Top Performers:**

* Long QURE  371.89&amp;#37;
* Long AVXS  134.96&amp;#37;

0,2803,Why $TSLA is a good long term short,"Tesla is not a goo long term play in the least. Let’s ignore that they haven’t made a car less than 50k yet, the federal tax rebate is getting halved , and they need to raise another round of funding adding even more debt to this company. Let’s go with the assumption they are making 15k per car gross (very generous for a 35k car).  So they make 15k per car gross and another then take 5k+ off for corporate expenses (G&amp;A/R&amp;D). Now at 10k a car and say they produce 10,000 a week(which is also ludicrous Tesla’s demand is way less than 520,000 cars a year over the next 2-3 years analysts peg about 320,000 orders currently having lost 24% of orders net YoY).

That’s 5.2 Billion in EBITDA roughly using favorable terms (10k profit/car, producing and having enough demand for 10,000 cars a week) while still having terrible cash flow due to all the debt. Now we have to assign a multiple to the EBITDA: GM trades at ~3x EBITDA, FIAT at 2.5x, Ford ~2.2x, Toyota at 9x EBITDA, Nissan at ~2x, Volkswagen at 1.5x, Mercedes at 2.2x. As can been seen it’s a very low multiples industry. Let’s assume it trades at 9x like Toyota to give it a high end that’s a share price of 217 on the high end after accounting for debt value, more in line with the rest of the industry other than Toyota; if it trades at a low 3x in line with the rest of the industry it’s worth about 50 bucks.

I also think having some of the traditional telecomm dividend cash cows in this shit is good.  Sure, T is tanking right now but they're dividend is solid and stuff to provide a little bit of stability.

TL;DR: This etf blends the sexiness of GOOG and FB with the Buffett-ness of T and VZ.

This post is designed to share my logic simply and transparently. Twitter down, Square up. Feel free to browse my post history, I have nothing to hide.

Thankfully, Jack is willing to whore out his children to the rest of us plebs through Initial Public Offerings. I've been balls deep in Square since it was young enough for the liberals to argue that my lust for it was just a quirk of my sexuality.   


Jack knows his kids very well, and some of you degenerate fucks may face a similar problem to Jack after you somehow succeed in reproducing. Life isn't fair, and sometimes, you give birth to runts. $TWTR may have been born first, but recently $SQ has been stealing all of $TWTR's tendie rations like Winston in 1984. Sure, you may look at the chart and claim that this negative correlation is not evident yet, but all it takes is this earnings szn to prove my point.

   A bearish looking setup though I'm not 100% convinced it will play out.  10 point range before you can tell for sure if you're wrong or right so choose your entries carefully.

  Best case scenario we trade down towards a target of $2754 area before the market opens however if we can hold price around last close, I would still be looking to short any rallies up against $2832 area . Above $2842 intraday setup is no longer valid.  

  $VIX  - Volatility Index https://i.imgur.com/0rZ2Fir.png

Showing signs of bottoming which can hopefully bring volatility back to around 19's or higher in august.

  $CL Crude Futures  https://i.imgur.com/meJN9pL.png

Crude is trying its best to stay above this strong resistance at $69.38 that spans back to 2007-2009-2010.  Longer term is setting up for a reversal but still has room up to $71-75 if we can start to see closes above $69.38.  If that holds you can use that as a point to buy but its in the middle of a huge range so stay probably best to see if this area can hold before making any serious commitment.


$AMZN Amazon https://i.imgur.com/ETDGDao.png

Last week was its chance for continuation north of $1900's but since it failed to close at highs, its setup is more tilted towards a reversal in the coming week.  $1863 looks to be hard resistance so if it fades there, you'll have your confirmation.

$TSLA - Tesla https://i.imgur.com/sde4gz1.png

  Don't trade this.  $TSLA will find a way to fuck you regardless if you're long or short. If you're already short $278 is a very reasonable place to take some profit. GL

$FB - Facebook https://i.imgur.com/Em1d8ok.png

  Facebook showing a relatively reliable topping pattern but again, range is wide and we're right in the middle.  I'd be looking to fade rallies up to $195 rather than buying dips here.



  TLDR.  Markets are starting to show that weakness is a likely possibility come August,  Bullish continuation signs are fading but not completely out of the picture.  Room to make money  long or short but safer to sell rallies than to buy dips until more clarity.  If the market fails to break out and goes sideways long enough it can easily kill any big selloff next month.  Let me know any stocks you'd  like me to look at and I will try my best to post what I see.

Their low-debt doesn't hurt them as much as other tech companies in a higher interest rate environment, though. The drop right now isn't proportional to other tech companies dropping.

Cat food and pet medicine stock. Thanks to a massive oversupply of liberal arts degrees,  careerism trends, and feminist propaganda, 1-800-PetMeds ($PETS) has  seen booming growth in sales over the past year. In North America, young  adults are 8 times as likely to own a pet than a child, and pets are  now twice as likely to be vaccinated as children.

The  $30.6 billion U.S. pet food market is expected to grow 5.4% a year over  the next five years, but more importantly, the proliferation of  internet pornography continues to drive down marriage rates, and by  implication, drive up pet ($PETS) ownership rates, especially among  women.

$PETS uses an online model similar  to Amazon to disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar retailers and uses an  omni-channel approach to support rapid growth. Revenues are growing 13%  yoy and growth continues to be supported by unusually high prices on  prescription products.

The rising  standards of living for humans will trickle down to pets, and humans  will continue to spend more on pet health compared to how much we spend  on our own health. Long $PETS

Im a 10+ year daytrader who trades professionally and founded [LiveAlertsTrading.com](https://livealertstrading.com/), chatroom for professional traders.

$Torc was gapping up premarket, historical resistance was at $20.50 and $19.50.

It had a major sell off in morning down $1.50, indicating this was weak. I also checked SEC filings and and news and saw it was a fluff piece, no real indication that the stock should be up. Given the transfer of shares from yesterdays highs to premarket, there was a strong indication large investors had sold their positions, therefore there was NOT going to be big money holding this thing up, especially when its up over 50% from yesterdays close.

I shorted at $19.09, and covered 3 hours into the day at $15.20, for +20,171.

0,3055,Keep your eye on $AAOI in after hours today. YUGE earnings play potential.,"tl;dr if you see AAOI spike bigly in after hours go ahead and throw your entire net worth into those stonks.  

\&amp;nbsp;  

Here's what you need to know. AAOI is based in the US and labeled a semi conductor company. But really, they're more into fiber optics and data centers, and the only thing they actually do in the US worth a shit is R&amp;D. The long and short of it is, AAOI has great long term outlook, but they are getting mollywhopped in the short term currently(like many semis due to Yuan issues and trade war talks). This is worsened by the fact that they never say anything besides on the day of earnings. Many if not all of their clients are bound up in NDA's. In addition to this, some of the projects have huge business cycle lengths that don't allow profits to be seen for a while. However, in last quarters earnings it was stated that there were a number of big players who had contracted with AAOI, and that investors would start to see the gains from that and from previous partners. This is really important for guidance and you will see why later. 

\&amp;nsbp;  

What is really important is the data center aspect. Revenue growth from that has been extreme in china and taiwan over the last couple of years. This contrasts with a majority of CAT5 projects they used to do which have very long business cycles, the data center projects they have are way faster in the time to completion which in turn leads to more profits in the short term. Also, a proxy company that handles almost everything for AAOI outside of the US just recently filed with the SEC that they were taking on a loan from a Taiwanese bank. My guess is they will be using that to finance projects there because AAOI doesn't really have a huge debt/equity ratio currently. Plus it would be good to see on QE report that production was ongoing in Taiwan and china regardless of trade talks.  

\&amp;nbsp;  

Here's the play. AAOI for reasons unknown has a fucking massive short interest ratio, 61.49% last reported. I tried to look into it as some sort of convertible bond play, but that only accounted for like a 1.5 to 3% short interest ratio. I'm guessing it has just been labeled as a consensus short. In addition to this, 70% of AAOI is industry owned, which leads me to believe this a little more. As we talked about earlier, AAOI has great long term growth outlook, so at some point all of these shorts will have to cover because AAOI should be getting better valuations through 2018-19(especially Q42018 Q12019) that will drive the stock price higher. But for all we know this earnings could very well be the catalyst for a short squeeze of Enron Musk proportions.  

\&amp;nbsp;  

But if their earnings goes to shit the short sentiment will be regarded as true and the stock will tank. That is why I don't recommend doing anything until you see what happens after hours. Also the premiums on these options are ridiculous so a poor fag like myself will probably just stick to the stocks so I can still profit if a short squeeze happens. Here's hoping to The Big Squeeze ya filthy animals.  Also to all the other poor fags that use RH you have no excuse not to check this since RH allows free after hours trading now.

0,3058,$CORT calls = guaranteed tendinitis next week,"Corcept has been deputy dan'd 35% since mid-June on no tangible news. Some Stifel jagoff reminded everyone to be scared of a Teva generic for Corcept's drug Korlym, essentially their only profit source, but that was May 31st and the downtrend started on June 15th. And Corcept has protection from a Teva ANDA being filed until October 2020 cause of the 30-month stay rule. 

By the time a generic comes out, just about every analyst who knows his shit and eats his tendies says Corcept's other drug Relacorilant will take over Korlym's market space. Korlym is the same compound as the RU-486 abortion pill so it messes with strange and whatnot. Relacorilant is about to be in phase 3, has had results thus far that have outperformed Korlym, and doesn't make chicks shit kids. So even if Teva isn't chapter seven elevening by 2020 and spits out a generic Korlym, they're not taking any market space. 

Here's some earnings highlights boys

* Revenues have grown at a CAGR of 117% in the past 5 years
* Earnings have grown for seven straight quarters
* Current FY2018 revenue guidance of $275-300 million implies revenue growth of almost 100% YoY
* Completely debt free
* 101% ROE, 86% ROA, 85% ROI
* Shares getting bought back slowly
* SH equity quadrupled last year
* Teva is down 82% since buying that generic shitshow Actavis in '15

Add to all of this the fact that the FDA estimated Korlym has an addressable market size five times bigger than its current market share. CORT mgmt says awareness is the most vital driver of patient base growth, so [this](https://khn.org/news/how-a-drugmaker-turned-the-abortion-pill-into-a-rare-disease-profit-machine/) yolo inducing article by Kaiser Health which NYT and Chicago Trib syndicated to their &gt;100m readers at the beginning of April should have proliferated that three digit revenue CAGR enough for a record earnings blowout.

Europe is currently going through one of the hottest heatwaves on record. (Reaching close to 116 F in dusty ass places like Greece).

So people will be drinking every ice cold drink they can get their hands on.

The average European temperature for each Quarter is as follows:

As well as some historical quarterly data:

This graph also shows the quarterly temperature difference overlaid against quarterly sales volume change, showing a pretty fucking direct correlation.

$KO has already released their earnings report last week, and reported a revenue of $8.9B. 4.2% more than the $8.54B estimate.

Despite slowing sales in North America, growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa increased and drove the share price up by 2.3% within the first three hours of trading.

Now Coca Cola’s European bottling company $CCE is due to release earnings on Thursday. European sales have increased  (As mentioned in $KO ER last week), judging by past performance, the hot temperatures will increase sales by about +3%, and volatility for the company remains low at around 22%.

This bastard has beaten earnings every quarter since their mid-2015 IPO, except for their last report which only met estimates. The stock dropped about 5% afterwards, but had experienced a 23% 3-month run up and was up 100% YTD, so it probably just needed to cool off. 

Current Price = $47.77 

IV Rank = 57.4

IV Ind = 49.3

PE = 90 (industry average of 22)

**Previous Earnings**

* 5/8/18: Met .27 EPS (fell 4.7%, 23% runup to ER, up 100% YTD)
* 2/2218: Beat .24 vs .23 EPS (jumped 12.1%)
* 11/7/17: Beat .19 vs .16 EPS (jumped 17.3%)
* 8/9/17: Beat .22 vs .19 EPS (Jumped 9.1%)

**Notables**

* Their EPS estimates this year are a little more aggressive than year's past, so they've got some lofty goals. But if met, they should continue to rise. 
* Hit 52 week high of $50.73 on 7/26. Currently about 6% off.
* They've had 45 consecutive quarters of positive comps and there are several price targets out there in the mid to upper $50's. 
* Plenty of institutions increased their holdings around 1st QTR this year as well.

0,3160,Some FEYE DD from a noob,"Hello all, I'm kind of a noob to trading as I only started in June, but I've been trading heavily since then. I paid my tuition in the form of IQ, but I've bounced back since then on some non-meme plays. Anyways, basically what I'm trying to get across is that you shouldn't listen to me at all, as I'm probably retarded. But maybe you'll find this useful.

So $FEYE recently had earnings last week 1-AUG-2018, and their earnings call reported that their customers were happy to refresh their service contracts as well as add on new products, in fact the trend appearedto be for customers to add on new products overall. They reported growth with their Helix suite, and they beat earnings (estimate -0.01, actual 0.00), and raised guidance. That's the TLDR version, anyways. So outlook seems great for FireEye, and I'm personally bullish as I think they have a great product and a good position in the market. The cyber security space is crowded, true, and we will definitely see consolidation in the future, but I think FireEye stands a chance of coming out on top. 

But the real reason to play this stock, imo, is the short term cyclical nature of the stock. I think this stock is quite similar to MU in the fact that it quite reliably goes up, then down within a pretty consistent range of $15 on the low end, and $17-18 on the high end. Right now, the RSI for this stock is at 36, and to my eyes the MACD is at an inflection point, heading towards the signal line. On balance volume has been growing steadily since late june/early july, and overall I think the technicals look like the stock is about to go back into the $16-17 range as the cycle continues.

I'm personally holding 30 contracts 16C 9/21 @0.38 per contract. Last time I played this stock I bought a 15C expiry was in july. Cant remember the date, but i closed the position with 94% profit on the call.  

I'm interested in what you all think of this stock, I did a search and it seems like WSB has played it before but not recently it seems. ",2018-08-07 17:39:26,['FEYE']

Yext created a whole new market segment called DKM-digital knowledge management. They are a ten year old company which has been public for about a year. Going public allowed them access to capital which let them expand and win many partnerships this year including Yelp, TripAdvisor,Google and Amazon.  It's a simple product. On the surface they allow merchants and businesses to update the information that appears on search engines and review pages.  Under the hood it's a beautiful AI play with rich and complex ramifications.  The digital Knowledge Assistant interacts with companies and let's them know when and how to change their info. For instance if people are searching How many calories in a big Mac on their alexa, the KA will prompt the neighborhood Burger Restaurant to add the info to their website along with their hours of business and whatever else info is pertinent.  

-Management is stellar. Highly ranked on Glassdoor, recently named best place to work by Fortune. Keeps winning partnerships. Last big pop was a big win with Alexa 

-Expected revenue this quarter is 54 million ish. However, due to new features and partnerships I think this is a very conservative estimate.  Good chance of a big beat.  

-Last earnings call they mentioned a line about being worried about capital expenditures due to their spending on annual conference. Now they just announced David friggin Blaine will be entertaining them. Just an aside but I think this speaks as to just how confidant they are going into this report.  

-Company is currently cash flow positive, many catalysts this spring/summer, history of big beats.  

I bought calls and stock.

Edit: Earnings isn't till first week of Sept. Stock is currently range bound by about 5%. Possible to wait for a sale before buying. If you're a masochist and like being glued to your computer can wait till last week and write calls to capture theta/iv

EPS of $1.17 and non-GAAP EPS of $1.20, up 38 percent and 40 percent year over year, respectively 

Record revenue and operating income in Applied Global Services and Display 

 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Applied expects net sales to be in the range of $3.85 billion to $4.15 billion; the midpoint of the range would be approximately flat, year over year. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.92 to $1.00; the midpoint of the range would be an increase of approximately 3 percent, year over year. 

EPS estimated was $1.10, actual is $1.20.

While this market is going whereever it wants, im curious to see what will happen today.

The company reports earnings this Wednesday after market close, and is primed for a pop from the low following strong retail sector numbers earlier this week. 

L Brands has moved sharply downwards over the past two years as ""real beauty"" trends have pushed both retail competitors and institutional investors away from 'idealized' models and 'male-focused' lingerie products. This trend can only move so far however, and while larger sizes certainly exist, investors seem to have forgotten that Vic Secret holds a dominant brand and moat-protected competitive positioning in small-sized products aimed at younger women. The VS Fashion show is unrivaled among corporate names in viewership, and the list of names employed as Angels total a combined 100m followers on instagram. Additionally, overt feminist trends have stalled and begun to reverse in the Trump era.  

The stock currently trades at a tiny 6x P/E ratio, a number usually reserved for dead and dying companies. $LB however has posted 8% revenue growth its last quarterly, and has recently expanded into China with a huge flagship store in Shanghai, targeting overseas demand for American brand name products.

1. Spicy Tendies delivered. Grubhub is beggining to roll out delivery partnerships with chick fil a. You fags wanted to play chick fil a spicy tendies, heres your chance.
2. Makes bank and doesnt even have to deliver. Grubhub offers both a delivery service, in which their drivers go out and generate grub profit, but they also make a massive amount of money just being an online ordering service for small businesses. Grubhub takes a percentage of every order placed through their ordering service, this includes pick up orders. Restaurants are basically forced to be on grubhub, even when they have their own online ordering, because they are otherwise missing out on a massive customer base.
3. Grubhub bought out eat24 (yelps ordering service), now all orders placed through yelp go through Grub.
4. Bitches be lazy, I work for a pizza shop that uses grubhub, as well as our own delivery service. If you order through our site the delivery is completly free, but if you order through grubhub there is a delivery fee. Despite this, our store does 38% of its business through people ordering via grubhub. Grub is taking 7% of these sales. When I make deliveries, I tell people that they should just order through our website and get free delivery. 9/10 I am told by a disgruntled fat guy that they know but their wife keeps ordering through grubhub.

It's new RTX 20xx cards look and sound dope. All that Ray tracing and HDR and neural net tech going into them sounds amazing, but the problem is (most likely) NO ONE'S GONNA BUY THEM.

They are twice the price of the current gen GPUs from Nvidia and most likely won't increase normal game performance by any more than 50% max. And it's doubtful that they will even get that much performance at all for most games. In addition, all of that new fancy tech is essentially useless for 99% of current games. The new Ray tracing tech decreases frame rates dramatically as well. (All of this can't be confirmed until the cards are actually released fyi)

The YouTube channel [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI8iQa1hv7oV_Z8D35vVuSg) has some great videos explaining this so check those out.

In addition, Nvidia's marketing of these GPUs has been straight up wack, and they seem very reluctant to release any real world performance numbers without doctoring the graphs or giving away too much info. Seems a little fishy... 



In summary, be weary of this stock. Once the preorder hype dies down and people actually get their hands on these cards I think they'll realize how overpriced and underperforming these GPUs will be for the average consumer and $NVDA will go dowwnnnnnnn.",2018-08-24 14:24:38,"['NVDA', 'NVDA']"

0,3563,Saturday Short: $ZN - Zion Oil and Gas,"Good morning losers, 

I present you the best short on the market other than Tesla. $ZN

This shitty company has somehow existed for 18 fucking years on the thesis of drilling for oil in Israel. With zero revenue to date, Zion has raised capital by advertising via televangelists, claiming they will fulfill a biblical prophesy. This can be seen by the massive marketing expenses in their 10k. 

Their employees then embezzle most of this money with ludicrous salaries. Of the 33 employees in the company, the median salary is 139k, with the CEO bringing home 450k/year. Over the years, they have taken home 17% of all capital raised. 

Earlier this year, Zion made claims that their well #5 had struck oil, and would asses the commercial viability over the next few weeks. Some three months later, Zion announced the well had proven to be commercially unsuccessful and would need capital to move forward in drilling more wells. 

Zion has been able to raise capital via equity dilution over the last 18 years, but has run into headwinds with an SEC investigation at their door. This requires them to disclose the investigation as a part of any equity raise. Now the company has roughly $8m of cash on the books, 6.7m of it earmarked for current liabilities. The company is also entangled in a class action lawsuit which could result in another couple million in liability. On top of it all, the company maintains burn-rate of roughly 2m a quarter. 

With the stock down 80% off it’s 2018 highs, the stock currently sits a 1.53. Given the inevitability of delisting/and or bankruptcy, the $1 puts for any maturity are an attractive purchase. My personal strategy is to own an assortment of puts from Sep18 to Mar19. 

TLDR: $ZN has no revenue, and exists by selling stock to gullible bible belters  SEC now involved, stock going to 0.

Added more 135Cs on Friday and some 140s yesterday and bought back the short calls for a tiny profit

It had a big ass spike at open today to 146 - no idea why - and I was tempted to bail but it happened so fast I couldn't really figure out a reasonable limit price before it started to drift back down

At any rate it's currently sitting at 140 having recovered from lows around 133 last week after the post ER dump. Looking for an exit at or above 150 within a month so I think there's still plenty of upside left here.

Here’s my DD. I recently bought a 2019 Ford Raptor. It was very expensive, most expensive purchase of my life. It took me for-fucking-ever to get one, even after I committed. I’d show up at lots (Atlanta area) and they would have 4 or 5, but they’d all be sold (except the fucking red one, every time). I found one at an AutoNation and left to go think about it. Went back the next day, sold. Another week or so later and I saw one (gray) and I went in, talked to the guy, went to the office, returned like 30 minutes later and the thing was sold. I couldn’t believe it. So I got talked into putting a deposit down, and had to wait like 3 more weeks before it arrived. It was ridiculous, but fuck I love that thing. 

Sales manager had been with Ford forever. Says they’re basically just going to start making trucks now, which they sell a shitload of. The Ford F-150 is the number one vehicle registered to millionaires in the United States. I’m not saying Ford doesn’t suck, they do, but they’re trucks are cool and if you disagree, you’re wrong. I think if they just focus on that and the customer experience for their large and better customer base (f150 owners) they could be alright. Fuck all those other cars though, I don’t even know why they make them.

0,3711,Covered Calls Income - August Recap,"Hello WallStreetBets,

&amp;#x200B;

Last month I created [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/95675f/covered_calls_income/), and I said that I would follow up with how I am sticking to my covered call only strategy. My goal is to make $500 a month off of around $20,000 to $25,000 in investments, which is 24%-30% annually. Although I cheated and played with calls and puts, I stuck to the spirit of my original post and only SOLD these calls/puts.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are [my trades](https://i.imgur.com/Ocyv0CM.png). I'll explain each one and plan what I should do next month.

&amp;#x200B;

1. KR Put **\[NET GAIN: $8.40\]** : I had money sitting around so I wanted to sell a put. I didn't mind owning Kroger at that price either. I made $8.40 lol. Put expired worthless and the strike was $29.00. I did this trade before I made my original post.
2. TWTR Call **\[NET GAIN: $145.35\]** : I bought 100 shares for $32.05 and sold a call with a $32.50 strike. Twitter shot up so I bought my call back and sold the shares. Unfortunately, I was in class and did not calculate this on my spreadsheet, and due to commissions, this trade cost me $19.60. I should have let it expire. Although I did make $281.55 on the shares, buying back the call lost me $136.20. 
3. KR Call **\[NET GAIN: $85.35\]** : I bought 100 shares for $30.05 and sold a call with a $30.50 strike. I let the call expire and the shares get called away from me. I made $39.95 (not official, this will happen on Tuesday after Labor Day weekend) on the shares being called away and $45.40 on the premium collected for selling the call.
4. MU CALL **\[NET GAIN: $115.40\]** : I bought 100 shares for $52.52 per share. I sold a $54.50 strike call. I collected some SWEEEEET MU premium, and I still own the shares.
5. CVS CALL **\[NET GAIN: $205.73\]** : I love CVS. I've been selling calls on it for a while now. My cost basis (not including premiums collected before) is $68.73/share. $69.50 strike. I bought back the call a week before expiry and sold the shares. Doing that made me an additional $80 so that was a good call.
6. AMD PUT **\[NET GAIN: 60.40\]** : $19.50 strike. I wish I bought calls lol.
7. MU PUT **\[NET GAIN: $36.40\]** : I had already sold my shares of CVS and TWTR so I had cash sitting around. I figured I'd sell an MU put and collect some SWEEEEET MU premium. Sold the put with a strike of $50.50. *I haven't really gotten into strategies yet, but I think this is called a covered strangle*. This contract expired worthless. Even if it had been exercised, it would have let me reduce my cost basis on MU (shown in #3).
8. IQ CALL AND PUT **\[NET GAIN: $63.80\]** : Fuck IQ I guess lol. My cost basis was $33.50 from a put I sold last month. I sold a $33.50 call (expired worthless, collected $24.40). Also sold a $29.50 put (got exercised, collected $39.40). Now I have 200 shares at $31.24/share (decent I guess). The problem with IQ is that it dropped so low that I couldn't get decent premium until I sold the call and put on the 27th of August, so the Monday of the expiration week.

\*ALL THESE CONTRACTS EXPIRED THE 31ST, EXCEPT FOR #1

For the month of August, I made $720.83. The problem is any idiot could've made money this month, even though my main strategy (covered calls) is used for sideways or slightly bearish markets. I am hoping I can continue to make over $500/month in the coming months.

&amp;#x200B;

I am considering using diagonal spreads to sell calls against, I need to research the strategy more. I am also considering buying 100 shares of $BABA and selling monthly calls (which is $500 premium for my chosen strikes) lol.

0,3730,Biotech write up: $AVMXY DD inside,"Posting what I wrote in another sub:

Lads, I've benefited quite a bit from multiple subs and wanted to give my two cents about a stock I see immense potential in(will put this elsewhere as well)

AVMXY is Avita medical. It's an Australian company listed as an OTC. Their claim to fame is a product called RECELL. 

What RECELL basically does is use a RES system which is regenerative epithelial suspension for burn victims. It is an autologous suspension that contains cells necessary to regenerate epidermis and provides a way to above closure if burn wounds. We all know burns aren't going away anytime soon and be seen in anyone from combat victims to fire victims or car accidents. Their product mainly comes into play for third degree burns and sometimes in second degree burns where skin grafting may be needed(taking skin from one part of the body and placing it on another). They did a multi centered randomized  controlled trial which was published which showed that patients who got their product RECELL essentially :
- required 97% less skin graft than those who did not
- had possible faster wound healing
- had less pain during recovery (burns are obv painful)

This is huge and potentially transformative for the burns industry. It is not currently approved but it's PMA application is currently being reviewed by the FDA and a decision is likely in Q3. The company is very confident that this will be approved and has already started production. Earlier in the year the FDA approved an increase in the number of patients who could be treated with RECELL under its compassionate use of investigational decide exemption program(basically allowing experimental therapy in extreme cases). They thus used it on 108 patients.this and its study results almost guarantees approval of the product which will be huge.

Imagine every burn center carrying Recell if it is approved. That's big.

I see one of a few possibilities:
-it gets listed on NASDAQ
- it gets bought out by another company
- nothing happens and it loses steam

I think the third is very unlikely given how this product can change management of burns. The first two possibilities are likely. It is currently $1.47/share which is still cheap. I can't predict how high it'll go but I do see an upward trajectory.

Constraints:
It is an OTC stock and these entail more risk than other stocks since they aren't as ""vetted."" That being said, they have already started in Europe and china so that's a good sign.
Also, interestingly it's been very quiet. Other than a couple of people mentioning it before, I haven't really seen it ""take off"" on Reddit. I believe mainly coz it's an OTC.

I see big things for AVMXY and I just bought quite a bit over the last week. FYI I am not trying to shamelessly promote this. I'm trying to give my two cents as DD and if you guys like please research the stock, company and the medical evidence. DONT  buy just coz I said so. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.

Recent separation from MetLife has created increases operating and hedging expenses but a lot of that should go down over the next 6-18 months. Basically just costs a lot of money to recreate all the operating and hedging stuff under a new company. The company is new but the business is old and undervalued by any and every metric. It's not a sure thing they turn it around this quarter and long-term growth is doubtful but the assets they hold are currently worth 25% more than the current stock price so there is limited downside risk.

I don’t know how the market will react to it, but it would be a better play for long calls.

Look at spike in $MU bullish posts in Seeking Alpha... It's a desperate attempt to find dumb money imo.

My guess:

Management knows earnings will be shit, and/or guidance is going to be deep shit, so they delayed the buyback and mentioned memory prices will dwindle. They will not pay top dollar for a buyback. My guess is they are not buying back at all, look at what happened in 2015.

It's clear that the entire semi sector is being discounted (a stock screener and rank I run has MU, LRCX, AMAT, and ON in the top 10). However memory pricing isn't a death knell for semis, even if it is treated that way.

Micron can make up on any potential memory pricing drops (and have been and expect to) through increases in margins, sales mix, volume, and ASP. 

**Per BofA ML:**

&gt; We believe the recent share-price correction is mostly based on concerns of a downturn.
&gt; Our research indicates record-high revenue/profit. True, memory chip prices are no
&gt; longer rising, but this does not mean a downturn as cost cuts and sales volume increase.
&gt; We still model FY19-20 EPS at $10-11, which implies only 4-5x P/E and 3x EV/EBITDA.
&gt; Our $100 PO is derived from a 2.5x P/B (historical average 1-2x) due to high ROE (fair
&gt; P/E only 10x), and supported by DCF (8% WACC, FCF yield over 10% for the long term).

**Per JP Morgan**

&gt; Longer term, the company’s increasing product (DRAM, NAND, NOR) and
&gt; end-market diversification should dampen revenue/earnings volatility and
&gt; also position the company to do well in markets (handset) that require
&gt; multiple types of memory.

• Micron should benefit from secular trends in mobile DRAM that should help
it reduce volatility to commodity DRAM. Post the Elpida acquisition, we
believe Micron will be positioned well to benefit from secular trends in
mobility, networking, and cloud computing.

• New technology, divestiture of non-core assets, and cost-cutting efforts
should help it improve gross margins and profitability in the coming quarters.
Valuation

&gt; Our Dec 2018 price target of $84 assumes that Micron should trade at ~10x (in
&gt; line with the memory peer group average over the past several years) mid-cycle
&gt; earnings power of ~$8.40. We believe memory fundamentals remain solid in the
&gt; midterm, and management’s focus on improving margin profiles across business
&gt; segments (particularly in its NAND segment) should drive better profitability.
&gt; Above-average upside potential from current levels drives our Overweight
&gt; rating.

Another point, per u/cyphr0n

&gt; By SEC rule, a company cannot buy back its shares for a 5 week period which ends 2 days after the ER. This is why even though the buy period has begun in September, there are no buy backs yet.

0,3961,Puts on $PLAY for earnings on Friday morning.,"So I’ve sworn off earnings plays for a while, but if I was a degenerate fuckhead, I’d be looking at puts on $PLAY for this Friday’s earnings.

Main reasoning being that $PLAY (Dave &amp; Buster’s) derives a lot of business from “corporate outings”. For those of you that don’t work with the washed masses in the corporate business world, these are generally departmental outings where everyone goes out during the afternoon to blow off some steam and see if they can land their very own #metoo moment over by the machine you drop tokens into hoping to push other tokens off the magnetically protected cliff. It’s a good catch all place where everyone can eat and generally have a decent time away from the office.

But if some of you recall from a few weeks back, $ELY earnings plays were being hyped simply due to the fact they hold a ownership stake in Top Golf. Rightly so, their ER was strong and the stock had a nice pop. 

I don’t know what some of you may have observed, but these things are raping and pillaging the corporate outings customer base. Top Golf has been popping up in major cities left and right and they are always PACKED. I’ve got to think this is pulling business away from $PLAY, and I’m curios to see if they mention lowered guidance, revenues, or even just cop to the fact they are facing increased competition.

Anyways, do what you will with this info. 

TLDR; Top Golf is stealing the corporate outing/event crowd from Dave &amp; Busters. ",2018-09-12 19:29:34,"['PLAY', 'PLAY', 'PLAY', 'ELY', 'PLAY']"

* **Introductory Ramblings**

As for $PTLA, I wrote [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8gwc3h/ptla_fda_approval_what_you_need_to_know_and_what/) here about approval of Andexxa. Even though I was correct, the play was not profitable if you held up until now. I personally believe that $PTLA is *heavily* undervalued and that buying into it right now holds very little risk when looking at it from a 12-month perspective. I have no price target for this play but I do have two potential price catalysts for the following 12 months. I have never given a 12-month prediction on here before because my plays are much shorter in general. I expect this play to be shorter than 12 months, but I am confident in it enough that I will hold and average down for an entire 12 months - if necessary. 

On another note, what spurred me to write this thread was Portola's graph today. Portola seems to have a heavy floor of $29/share today due to someone, or some entity, with a large limit-buy of $29/share. Whether this holds is beyond the point because times like these are always very interesting to me. Some one or some group out there is confident enough to create their own resistance. Now, it could be due to another reason, such as market makers pinning the price so options remain worthless. Options volume isn't strong enough for that in my opinion. Whatever the reason, and I know I'm rambling here, I found today's graph interesting and it convinced me to finally write this post. I've been wanting to write something on Portola for months now. 

-

-

* **Lengthy Background. Skip if you want.**

Portola's current troubles are not unlike Omeros' ($OMER) initial, unfortunate troubles with management and marketing. Although I will say that as far as bad management goes, Portola is much worse than Omeros' management used to be. On the other end of this stick, Portola's pipeline is magnitudes stronger than Omeros' pipeline. 

I will eventually write a longer article on this topic and about pharmaceuticals in general. The gist of it is that, while bad management can drive down stock price in the short-term, and is something to look out for when heading into FDA approvals -- due to badly written or performed studies, among other things -- a strong drug will remain a strong drug. And no company, no matter how horrible their management is, will be able to hold onto a multi billion-dollar drug and let it go to waste. Make no mistake, Andexxa can and will, either under Portola or another pharmaceutical company, generate net revenue well into the billions. 

I personally am of the belief that a well-marketed and produced Andexxa alone would have been worth over 4 billion dollars had it been approved and produced during its first PDUFA. Portola has wasted 2 years of patent time on Andexxa, but that's no matter. It will still net billions. 

-

The reason Portola dropped is because they had a loss of 106.2M in their most recently reported quarter. On top of this, their drugs were massively under-marketed. The most worrisome was Bevyxxa's revenue. Andexxa we knew was going to be low due to Portola's inferior production capabilities and [self-imposed restrictions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8gwc3h/ptla_fda_approval_what_you_need_to_know_and_what/dyftjin/) Regarding Portola's unusual decision in limiting sales of Andexxa, some theorize that Portola is pushing for better treatment results to leverage a buyout offer, though I am on the fence about such a theory. I am neither completely sold nor disagreeing. I will explain more another time. 

Bevyxxa's revenue being low points to a marketing team that is not ready, at all, to pitch sales to hospitals around the country. I say this a lot, but I will save longer explanation for when I write a longer article. I need to speak with a lawyer in half an hour, so I don't have much time here. Bevyxxa, not nearly as valuable as Andexxa, is a good drug worth a lot of money (I won't give it my own price target like I did for Andexxa). Its success hinges on Portola being able to convince hospitals to restructure the way they care for patients. This requires more effort than simply saying, hey, our drug is good. It takes a talented marketing team, whereas something like Andexxa would sell itself. 

When Portola reported a disappointing quarter, it cast into doubt their ability to market a complicated drug like Bevyxxa in the first place. Holding this concern and labeling it an unfortunate eventuality still does not, in my opinion, justify Portola's drop to such a low valuation of sub 2 billion dollars. Portola may be bad, but they cannot hold onto these two drugs forever and waste their potential. They are a publicly traded company and eventually the hammer will come down. It's just politics. 

Now, *when* that hammer comes down is another argument, but it will. And I highly doubt it would take more than 6 months. 

-

-

* **The Potential Catalysts**

The biggest potential catalyst is a buyout, and while I believe it's very possible for Portola, I do think that management are far too stuck up their asses to do it just yet. Once a company makes bad decision after bad decision, investors will stop giving them the benefit of the doubt. Portola is in this position right now. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, Portola needed approval of Andexxa first before they could consider selling themselves. They also need approval of their recently submitted PAS, which has a decision date by the end of this calendar year. 

This leads me into the next catalyst, which is approval of the PAS. This would open up Portola to mass-produce Andexxa and market it around the entire country. They would be able to do so the very next day. This alone is such a huge catalyst that it cannot be understated. Investors don't entirely believe it will be successful. This however doesn't matter to me because, if it's not successful, Portola will be forced to sell themselves to another company. These two catalysts are tied because I believe my prior theory to be unavoidable. Portola will not be able to justify wasting another year of Andexxa's patent life on a fourth failed approval attempt, and they will have to sell to a larger pharmaceutical company that can effectively tackle production and marketing.

If PAS does gain approval, not only will share price increase, potential for a larger buyout offer goes through the roof. However... I think Portola's management is misguided enough to think that they can market and produce their drugs effectively and make more money without going for a buyout. I don't know their internal revenue estimates or what buyout offers they've been receiving, but outside investors can only stare from the outside within and hypothesize that a buyout is off the table if Portola can generate positive EPS and keep up with production. 

Regardless of their mystic inner workings, I think a buyout is unlikely only because of how many bad decisions Portola has made thus far. I would not put it past them to make another bad decision. I could be off the mark and giving Portola's management a hard time, which I admittedly always have, but I need to see at least approval of PAS before I will change my mind on this. 

There are other catalysts, but these are the most pivotal. 

-

-

* **The Plays**

Basically I'm long on shares and I have tons of 2019 calls. I'm not leveraged in the margin-sense. I just have a lot of OTM calls for pretty much everything in 2019. I have strikes ranging from $35/share to $90/share. I bought and sold my $30 and $35 strike calls for a nice profit because I, by chance, timed the drop and rise from $25/share to over $28/share really well. 

I have no price target for this play because the price target can vary from $50/share with approval of PAS to over $100/share with a buyout. Depending on the catalyst, Portola's share price is not predictable, which is why I have so many different calls at different strikes. I also have shares in case my timing is completely wrong and my options expire worthless. 

This play, if you buy options, is incredibly risky. As are most of my plays involving options. You can buy and hold shares for significantly less risk, as long as your horizon is 12 months, but that is of course my humble opinion. Me being confident in this play does not mean you should automatically be equally as confident.

This the roadmap of this company:

- NIO, the Tesla Killer!!!

- NIO, stock prises rises, electric cars have a new player

- NIO makes a demonstration of future cars, they have more cameras and sensors than Tesla

- NIO granted a loan to build a factory to make said cars

- NIO moved 2 tons of dirt, getting ready for manufacturing 

- NIO expects deliveries in two years, 2021

- NIO key executives leave company for an actual car manufacturer

- NIO struggles to get the cars into customer hands

- NIO can't produce the cars, more difficult than expected, need more money

- NIO doesn't get the necessary funding, halting the production

- NIO files for bankruptcy. 


There is this false premise or illusion that startups have, it's called ""I can make electric cars because they are easier to make than gasoline"". Yes, an electric motor is much easier to manufacture and assemble into a chassis, but there is a lot more to cars than that, the unforeseen enemy of this short sighted entrepreneurs is scale. This startups think that they can be a massive manufacturer just because they can make one prototype. You can make the prototype as cool and fast as you want, that says nothing about your ability to manage a fleet of thousands of cars and customers. 


The only ones that are able to pull this off until now as a new player is Tesla, and that will be the case for a long time. The reason, is that Tesla focuses on what matters: delivering the product. You can see this thought manifest in the way they update the cars, releasing hardware features over time, how they started with roadster which was barely holding together, their customer service improvements, ability to fix cars... 


NIO, Lucid Motors, Faraday Future... all make the same mistake: make a car with unreasonable amount of features, gimmicks, sensors, futuristic dreams and designs... removing focus from what matters. It's very easy to detect this types of companies just by looking at their website and philosophy.


They try to beat Tesla in 0 to 60 times with a stripped out prototype and charge faster than a Tesla by swapping batteries or some 300Kwh cable that can't be used... when instead they should be bragging about their ability to deliver, fix, update and assist cars and talk about battery resilience in adverse conditions.


- When you enter NIO website the first thing you see is a futuristic prototype that will never exist, waisting they resources just to fool some gullible investors. Mercedes can waist their time into this, NIO fucking not. Tesla does not and it doesn't have this type of crap.

- They have battery swapping. This is a management hell, costly to install and implement, it's absurd on all levels and no one is going to buy this car because it takes 5 minutes instead of 30 minutes, the reason is that most people charge at home. You can just short any company that offers swapping.


They also must start by doing a niche product, catered to a specific audience. Tesla started with expensive roadster for example. The only company I see doing this is Porsche, which targets luxury and build quality which are two features where Tesla lacks.

#**Overview:**

Paratek Pharmaceuticals is a biotech company based out of Boston, who focuses on providing solutions enabling positive outcomes for patients…Which is literally every other biotech company.  A very generic mission statement, but that is besides the point because they want their story to be remembered, a good play to the social aspect that many companies are trying to be a part of in todays world.  Right now, this company is working on changing how bacterial infections are treated. With the most common treatment of bacterial infections being through intravenous methods, treatments are limited to hospitals and clinics where as they want to continue to develop a new class of antibiotics, aminomethylcyclines, which allows for different, more accessible venues for dosing.  

This company really wants to have a meaningful impact, which is a great sentiment to have.  To back their cause, they do have a successful pipeline so far and show promise.  Their staff and executive team display a long history of success with having worked on a combined 75 late stage developments (phase 3 and beyond), 47 NDA’s or MAA, and 51 product launches.

The CEO has worked with several different biotech industry at an executive or director role such as being a general partner at Abingworth LLP, and even currently serving on the board of directors at Adamas Pharmaceuticals and InMediata.  The COO and CFO both also have extensive history of success with major companies such as Pfizer, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, and Biogen.  All in all, the company has a successful group in the leadership roles where its not their first trip around the block.  They bring experience and knowledge to their positions. 

#**Pipeline:**

As previously mentioned, Paratek develops a class of antibiotics known as aminomethylcyclines, which have broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.  They have two products in their pipeline with several different potential indications.  Both products are derivatives of Tetracycline.  

**Omadacycline**

Omadacycline is a derivative of tetracycline in the form of aminomethycycline.  Over the past 70 years since the inception of tetracycline, an increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance to tetracyclines has made the products much less effective and limited in current use.  Formulated for both IV and oral dosing, Omadacycline is being developed for 5 different indications, with 3 awaiting approval in PDUFA.  

**Sarecycline**

Sarecycline is a Phase III candidate, oral tetracycline derivative being developed for the treatment of acne and rosacea in a community setting because of its narrow spectrum antibiotic characteristics in treating inflammation. The company has licensed all of the US rights to Allergan for the development and commercialization of the product, however retaining all rights outside of the States.  This large partnership shows confidence in the company from a powerhouse in the industry and will provide cashflow while reducing expenses. 

#**Specific Drug:**

We will be focusing on Sarecycline for this write up due to the upcoming PDUFA date which is expected to be mid October.  Paratek has partnered with Allergan to develop and commercialize SeysaraTM (Sarecycline) for the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris in individuals 9 years and older.  Designed to treat acne in a community setting, meaning that it is focused on treating bacteria which is causing acne in communal settings spread through interaction.  

Acne is the most common skin condition in the US, with an affected market of roughly 50 million individuals.  While there are many factors leading to the cause of acne, this company focuses on the bacteria, p. acnes, which lives on human skin and can often clog the pores.  Inside the pore, the bacteria multiply at an astounding rate due to the perfect environment for replication and cause the pore to become inflamed, causing acne to appear.  

Last December, the company and Allergan filed their NDA based on positive data from two Phase III studies, SC1401 and SC1402, which was accepted by the FDA.  The Phase III results met primary endpoints at all levels and revealed patients treated with Seysara demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in acne severity compared to placebo at 12 weeks.  

Both SC1401 &amp; SC1402 were designed to be replicative phase 3 randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 1.5 mg/kg per day of Sarecycline compared to placebo in the treatment of moderate to severe acne.

The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral Sarecycline 1.5 mg/kg per day compared to placebo in treating inflammatory acne lesions in subjects with moderate to severe acne based on Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) scale score and inflammatory lesion counts. Patients were randomized (1:1) into two treatment groups to receive either Sarecycline tablets (60 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg, providing a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day) or placebo once a day for 12 weeks.

Sarecycline was statistically significantly (p &lt; 0.004) superior to placebo with respect to primary efficacy endpoints. The most common adverse events (&gt;2%) reported in the Sarecycline group were nausea (3.2%), nasopharyngitis (2.8%), and headache (2.8%). The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events among Sarecycline-treated patients in the two studies combined was 1.4%.  The drug has proven itself to be super tolerable, minimal adverse effects, and statistically significant in working effectively. 

 

#**Current and Forecasted Market:**

The Global Cystic Acne Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10% during the forecast period 2017-2023. Mainly owing to increase in patient population. According to American Academy of Dermatology, in 2015, 60 million Americans have active acne and around 20 million have acne badly enough to cause scars.  Additionally, approximately 85% of people between the ages of 12 and 24 experience at least minor acne.  Rising prevalence of this condition in both developed and developing countries is driving the cystic acne market growth.  With Allergan’s license on the US market, this leaves the growing developing world market and European markets open for Paratek to control.  It is estimated by the American Academy of Dermatology Association that in 2016 alone, the costs associated with the treatment of acne exceeded $3 billion.  

Paratek’s focus on community bacteria treatment is ideal for developing countries such as the Asian Pacific, Middle East, and Africa.  While Europe has a huge market for acne treatment, the aforementioned markets are booming at a higher rate.  Countries such as India and China are the fastest growing due to the massive influx of population and high healthcare spending.  While Paratek is making money off of the US market through their license to Allergan, they will also be able to leverage the developed product and work on global commercialization to treat the rapid growing markets that will exceed the US market in short time.

#**Competition**:

There are a ton of tetracycline-based treatments for moderate to severe acne, however it is often revealed that the p. acne bacteria can be resistant to the treatments. The market for streatment of antibiotic-resistant p. acnes is a much smaller market.  A company, Foamix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. FOMX is developing FMX101 in late-stage studies for treating moderate to severe acne.  We shall see the results of their production and late stage study results in coming months.

#**Financials**:

Looking over their financial statements, they have recently strengthened their balance sheet by raising $159 million in proceeds from issuing convertible senior subordinated notes in April set to mature in 6 years.  They also amended the financial terms of the Hercules Loan Agreement they have, increasing the principal taken out by $10 million with the potential for an additional $20 million to be borrowed.  

They recently reported a net loss of $29.7 million, or -$0.94 per share, compared to last years $18.2 million for the same quarter, a YOY increased loss of roughly 50%.  Not good at all, however things are looking to turn around in coming months with pending approval of two drugs with several designations.  Costs were increasing due to the preparation for commercialization and additional headcount, increased marketing, and other commercial costs that the company is taking to prepare for approval and launch.  

The company states that they have cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities that value at a total of $321.1 million.  Their cash and cash equivalents make up $56 million of that value.  Not the best financial situation.

#**Review:**

My thoughts, MAYBE a short term buy.  It is currently trending down and could be bought for a swing trade up towards approval.  Between Sarecycline and also the coming potential approval of Omadacycline in early October, this stock can see a big swing up.  You can review the information on Omadacycline below, its well-articulated in their presentation and likely to be approved. 

http://paratekpharma.com/media/1598/corporate-september-2018.pdf

However, I have my doubts about the company.  They have diluted shares several times around events and it seems like a common trend for the company.  Antibiotics is a tough market to launch in and be successful in.  Thankfully with their partnership with Allergan, they can see success in that drug.  Allergan is a massive company with a massive sales force that will literally go to physicians and shove the product down their throats.  However, with Omadacycline, they have no such partnership.  Likely to see a weak launch, the company will probably burn a ton of cash fast trying to market the product Omadacycline, but will likely see income generated from the licensing of Sarecycline.  Will it offset, unlikely.  The company will likely take a hit trying to market off a weak launch, dilute investors even further to raise capital shortly after approval.  That, or the company will move to take on more debt, drawing that additional $20 million from their loan agreement.  

My plan of action, buy a position now at $9.30 and increase size of position if I see $8.75-8.50.  Sell immediately after news if positive with a price target of $11.  This will likely be a short-term play.  However, I would also consider waiting until approval to even make a move.  With their financial position and history of dilutions, I see the stock taking a hit following the results from the FDA throughout October.  The company’s plan and pipeline will see no short-term success.  Their plan is to lay the tracks down for future revenues and market share, with success coming in 3+ years.  I can see a smart play waiting until early November to enter a position, after both drugs have received notice from the FDA and following the stocks likely drop and holding a long-term, 3+ year position. 



#TLDR

Two options here.  Buy now and maybe average down if it drops under $9, then sell immediately on news.  Or, wait until after news comes out on the two drug candidates expected in October and then buy.  I would personally wait to buy following news and potential dilution.  The company has a history of diluting shares and I can see them doing it within a week or two of approval, if not same day.  I would look to buy for long term, 3+ years, early November as they are laying groundwork for future success and revenues.  ",2018-09-15 00:40:51,['PRTK']

0,4039,"$IMDZ - Immune Design, done for now Im drunk","#**IMDZ – Immune Design Corp**


#**Overview:**

Immune Design is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on developing treatments to enable the body’s own immune system to fight diseases.  Their focus lies on the oncology sector, having engineered technologies to activate the immune system’s natural ability to create tumor-specific cytotoxic T Cells to fight cancer.  Their belief is that their two main drug candidates will address what other therapies are currently lacking while having the potential to treat a broad patient population through either individual therapies or in conjunction with other mechanisms of action.  Although their main focus is the immuno-oncology, they believe that their candidates also have potential to serve in therapeutic realms such as infectious and allergic diseases as they have a few different collaboration and partnerships underway leveraging their GLAAS platforms.  

Immune Design’s management team, board of directors, and scientific advisory board boast a diverse group of individuals who don’t lack experience in the industry.  The CEO, Carlos Paya, has served as Vice President at Eli Lilly, President of Elan Corporation, and was also a professor of Medicine, Immunology, and Pathology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.  The company also has an extensive list of Doctors and PhD researchers backing the company’s advisory board and management team.
  

#**Pipeline:**

The company currently has 6 different products in their pipeline ranging from Preclinical to Phase II.  Still in the early stages of development, the company is actively seeking growth and partnerships to solidify their financial and developmental future.  Each of their GLAAS products, 3 of them, have partnerships lined up for the development and licensing of the candidates.  These partnerships include Sanofi, MedImmune, and Sanofi Pasteur.   To match their product collaborations, they are also working in conjunction with Merck and Genetech in clinical collaborations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of their immuno-oncology products. 
Their immuno-oncology pipeline also has 3 candidates targeting different forms of cancer.  Their entire pipeline is as follows:

 

#**Specific Drug:**

While the company has several different products filling their pipeline, we are concerned with CMB305.  Immune Design has entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Genetech, a member of Roche, to better evaluate the safety and efficacy of CMB305 cancer immunotherapy when combined with the investigational cancer immunotherapy atezolizumab in patients with soft tissue sarcoma.  

CMB305 is a prime-boost product designed to target tumors that express the NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen, specifically soft tissue sarcoma.  NY-ES0-1 is expressed in a large number of solid and liquid state tumors in varying degrees.  CMB305 is comprised of two parts, a “prime” and a “boost”, which are designed to work synergistically to induce anti-tumor cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response targeting the NY-ES0-1-expressing tumors.  It is also hypothesized that CMB305 will also generate memory CTLs, providing for long-term immune response systems while enhancing other immune anti-tumor mechanisms along the way.  

Currently, CMB305 is in different stages of clinical development, which include monotherapy Phase I as well as a fully-enrolled Phase II trial comprised of individuals with two subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma (synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma).  This combination study is utilizing either CMB305 with Genetech’s cancer immunotherapy TECENTRIQ, or atezolizumab alone. 

Last year, the company reported positive clinical and biomarker data for CMB305 as a monotherapy.  In 25 soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients with recurrent disease treated with CMB305, median overall survival (mOS) had still not yet been reached, with an overall survival rate at 12 and 18 months of 83% and 76%, respectively. These data compare favorably to mOS for approved second line and later sarcoma agents, which is only 12.4-13.5 months, as well as a published mOS of 11.7 months for synovial sarcoma patients specifically; the largest patient population enrolled in this trial. A disease control rate of 64% was observed, including durable tumor growth arrest in patients who had evidence of disease progression at study entry. Also, CMB305 was well tolerated, and generated a strong and broad anti-NY-ESO-1 immune response in &gt;50% of the patients, including evidence of antigen spreading – the induction of an immune response against other tumor antigens not targeted by CMB305. In addition, the presented data showing a statistically-significant association of an induced response and clinical benefit in a pooled set of patients treated with CMB305 or LV305. The immune biomarkers studied, including novel bio-markers derived from public TCRS may guide regulatory strategy via the selection of patients more likely to have survival benefit on CMB305 therapy benchmarks. 

Immune Design has received Orphan Drug Designation in soft tissue sarcoma for both components of CMB305 in the EU and US, and depending upon further trial results soft tissue sarcoma will be the first indication in which CMB305 will be filed for regulatory approval.  There is a significant unmet need in this market, and the company holds the stance that the potential benefit of CMB305 to patients will be higher safety for patients and improved survival rates. 


#**Current and Forecasted Market:**

Synovial sarcoma is a cancer in the joints with a five-year and ten-year survival for people with Grade 3 tumors or metastatic disease of less than 25% and 15%, respectively, and Myxoid round cell liposarcoma is a malignant tumor that most often occurs in the deep-seated soft tissues of the extremities. Currently marketed treatments have high toxicity, with up to 37% of patients experiencing Grade 3/4 Adverse Events. 
Soft tissue sarcoma is rapidly growing, expected to reach a global CAGR of over 8% over the next 6 years.  With over 50 different types of soft tissue sarcoma, it is a rare and diverse group of cancers that can develop from nearly any tissue.  There are approximately 13,000 individuals who suffer from soft tissue sarcoma each year, and with a high incidence rate and increased awareness about the condition, the market is expected to continue to expand.  
The current soft tissue sarcoma market size is valued around $700 million as of 2017, and with an expected CAGR of more than 8%, In 2017, 12,715 new diagnosis and 5,070 deaths due to STS were reported in the U.S. Bone sarcomas accounted for 3,373 new cases and 1,649 deaths in 2017. The lifetime risk of developing a sarcoma is 0.4%. Approximately 45.0% of bone sarcomas and 21.0% of STS are diagnosed in people in the age group of 0-35 years.  Currently, chemotherapy and targeted therapy are the only approved treatments for sarcoma.  Several immuno-oncology agents are also under investigation, with Immune Design leading the forefront to fill this unmet market need. 


#**Competition:**

The largest market competition are companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, and Celgene and others.  However, not all of these companies are focusing on developments in immuno-oncology and developing long term body resistance to tumors.   There is a large market for immuno-oncology that is unmet and waiting to be filled.  Novartis holds roughly 30% of the market share for sarcoma treatment, which Immune Design seeks to start to take if the product becomes approved.  


Financials:

MDZ reported loss of 29 cents per share in second-quarter 2018, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 30 cents and the year-ago loss of 54 cents.

Immune Design’s shares have lost 8.9% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 1.2%.  However their revenues are up this quarter YOY to $0.76 million mainly due to the collaboration with Sanofi for G103 and product sales to collaboration partners.  R&amp;D expenses are increasing as they are moving along their extensive pipeline through the clinical phases.   

Biggest note on their finances, Immune Design expects cash on hand to be enough to fund operations through the second half of 2020.  Due to their strategic partnerships and financing, the company is able to limit diluting investors or taking on greater debt.  The company has enough cash and cash equivalents, $73 million, to finance all operations for more than a year, which is a very rare occurrence in these small cap biotech companies. 


#**Review:**

My sort of concerns, the low rate of success that oncology drug candidates have with the FDA.  Cancer is a tough market.  Data shows that cancer drugs have the lowest success rate of making it from Phase I to FDA approval, a mere 3.4%.  Although, cancer trials that used biomarkers had higher success rates, though, and the overall oncology drug approval rate for 2015 was 8.3%, which was due to the booming immuno-oncology field.  So, although oncology drugs lag, immuno-oncology pulls does not.  The past few years, especially under the Trump administration, drug approval rates have been higher than ever in recent history.  

For this product, Phase II studies patients and provides researchers with additional safety data to refine research questions and develop further methodologies to study the candidate and efficacy.  They utilize this data to formulate Phase III protocols.  Will not really reveal any benefits of the drug or therapeutic effects, rather simply show the safety of the product with some minor data.

As stated earlier, the company believes that CMB305 to patients will be higher safety for patients and improved survival rates.  Along with Orphan Designation and the need to get effective drugs approved in the Oncology market, I believe the FDA will try to push a product such as this through. I have no fear of dilution due to the cash on hand to hold them for another two years. 

Looking at their chart, the stock price has held a $3.30 support zone for the past year, consistently bouncing off of these low levels producing 10% plus gains and even going as far up as $5.00 just a few months ago.  The volatility of this stock is fairly high, and I would personally use this to my advantage.  They diluted with a $80 million offering in October 2017 causing a massive drop in share price.  I doubt the company will seek to ruin their shareholder base further any time soon.  I feel a purchase at under $3.40 is a great move and holding for $4.00 minimum.  


#**TLDR**:

Shit looks like a solid buy at this cheap support level.  They are showing safety in their studies or hinting at it, Phase II is all about safety, and with the Orphan Drug designation they have potential to meet a dire need.  Plenty of cash on hand, already screwed their investors with a dilution a year ago, dont have to worry about a dilution for another year or so as they have cash on hand to operate for two years.  I can see a 20-30% increase in the next month or two going from $3.30 to $4.00 as my minimum price target.

They have contracts with some large carriers like Verizon and AT&amp;T.
There R1000 model is supporting Verizons 5G home, world's first 5G broadband internet service.
I think this could be big long term. 5G broadband promises speeds of 300-1gb internet, and pricing seems much lower.
For instance Verizon is launching the service at $50/month for current customers and $70/month for new users.
I currently pay AT&amp;T $50 for 50mbs internet and it's garbage.

It's online base and revenue has been rapidly growing in the past year and if this continues I could get on board with the valuation.

Shares of FTCH will start at $15.00 - $17.00. Farfetch is offering ~37.5M of these shares worth a total of ~$733.2M.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate to post old news but history repeats itself - Mind you this only goes back to June 2018 where the first rounds of tariffs were going on.  I'm livid I just took a position and boom new tariffs again.

&amp;#x200B;

From the article:

&amp;#x200B;

""**Reasons Behind the Stock’s Plunge**

The escalating fears of a trade war hampering the free flow of goods between countries are the main reasons behind the stock’s dismal performance.  In fact, on the fourth quarter conference call, FedEx’s CEO Fredrick Smith expressed his concerns on the same.

The fact that FedEx has a significant presence in China has given rise to worries over substantial revenue loss due to the weakening of trade following the tariffs. We note that FedEx opened a hub in Shanghai in January 2018 to strengthen its foothold in China.

Last week, the White House announced plans to impose 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of imports. President Donald Trump is expected to start taxing products worth $34 billion as early as Jul 6 while he will levy tariff on the additional goods of $16 billion later. Beijing said it will counter the move, imposing tariffs on U.S. soybeans and other farm products.""",2018-09-18 10:51:55,['FDX']

Now that we have gotten our weekly spectacle from $TLRY allow me to point you in the direction of a trade coming up.

$BX has their investor day this Friday (sep 21) , coinciding with some nice FDs.

The plan is the following: buy puts on Thursday in anticipation of the event Friday. Stock has run up on expectations that $BX will change to a C-Corp, like KKR which is up 30%+ since July.

Goldman did an analysis showing that this just isn’t likely due to the less meaningful benefit to the stock. They suggest you go long vol on the event, but with the stocks run up this week, I am thinking that I just want to be short.


I’ve got 25 36.5 weekly puts and 10 more 36.5 expiring Friday the 28th.

Originally had shares and rolled over to contracts and now riding those out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over 100% of the float is shorted (yes for u retards this is poissible. Perelman has been snapping up shares and he wants to take the company private. They have a backdoor provision in their contracts to transfer assets away from bondholders similar to Jcrew. He wants to do this while private so they face less scrutiny etc.. whatever yada yada. Right now out of 53.5MM shares effectively 2.5MM is the float sine perelman has 85%, indexes, and a few other activists investors are holding and have the intent to hold for quite a long time as you can see by the mittleman brothers 13F filings. This thing could overshoot HEAVY in the near term and it looks like perelman is going to have to announce private real soon. He has used these tactics many times before (buy when underlying is depressed following poor earnings - even though this is attributed to front end costs). He has paid anywhere between 50-100% premium when taking companies private.

Basically long revlon and count your fucking tendies. I'm sitting on Nov 25's right now (up 214% this is excluding my previous Sept 20's which I sold and profited from aswell as the shares).

I love $SSTI and I am holding a core position long term, but I've trimmed a lot between $55 and $60. They are pretty expensive now when comparing their ev/sales to other high growth software companies.

$EVBG, however, is much more attractive. I believe it has a lot of upside that we can see in the next few months. They have a lot of long term contracts which helps reduce long term risk. They have strong, accelerating revenue growth and they are being smart in their efforts to balance growth vs their path towards profitability. They are currently trading at around 12.5x ev/2018 sales. IMO they warrant at least 16x, implying an upside of \~28%, or \~$74 per share (trades around $58 now). 16x ev/2018 sales would be much more in line with what we see in other small cap/high growth tech companies.

With a stable balance sheet and a pretty damn attractive P/E multiple, I think additional downside is limited, at least in the near term.  

Depending on what the IV picture looks like in the AM, I may sell some covered calls on these shares.  The premiums should be fairly juicy.  And since I am never lucky enough to buy the bottom, the premiums will help shield my downside if this bitch decides to shed a few more percent in the AM.

Overview:

Selecta Biosciences is a clinical-stage biopharma company focused on oppressing the body’s immune response to make therapies more efficient.  They are combining their tolerogenic Synthetic Vaccine Particles (SVP) to multiple therapies for rare diseases.  They currently have 5 products in their pipeline which range from SVP-enabled enzymes and oncology, to gene therapies.  Based out of Watertown, MA, just outside Boston, the company hopes to treat patients that currently have ineffective or are completely lacking treatments.  

The company not only has a US base, but they also have a subsidiary in Moscow, Russia which is building a pipeline of targeted immunotherapies and vaccines in oncology and infectious diseases.  This is being developed off of their SVP candidates and their hope is to expand their portfolio of immunotherapies in conjunction with the research and development occurring in Boston.

The company has multiple collaborations going on currently because of their SVP product which interacts with the immune system and induces antigen-specific immune responses.  This broad application of the SVP products allows them to collaborate with other companies to test the compatibility of the SVP with their therapies.  

The collaborations that Selecta has are with 3SBio, Duke University Medical Center, Genethon, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, National Cancer Institute, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and 
the Skolkovo Foundation.  


**Pipeline:**

Representing a robust pipeline, this company currently has five different candidates ranging from Preclinical to Phase II while targeting several different therapeutic areas.  

SEL-212 – Chronic Severe Gout

SEL-403 – Pancreatic Cancer and Mesothelioma

SEL-302 – Methylmalonic Acidemia (MMA) – Gene Therapy

SEL-313 – Ornithine Transcarbamylase

Hemophilia A - Gene Therapy - provided Spark Therapeutics with exclusive worldwide rights.


While most of the products are in the Preclinical Phase, there is one in Phase II and another in Phase I.  Our main focus however is on SEL-212, Tophaceous Gout, which is expected to present Phase II five-monthly dose data at the ACR meeting with a pivotal trial to begin Q4 2018.  SEL-212 is a monthly treatment consisting of pegsiticase, a potent uric acid lowering uricase enzyme, administered alongside SVP-Rapamycin to prevent ADA (anti-drug antibodies) which might otherwise compromise the medications safety and efficacy.  


**Specific Drug:**

SEL-212 so far in clinical trials has demonstrated that it has the capability to significantly lower serum uric acid levels down to those conductive to rapid tophi dissolution and the reduction of flares and other symptoms.  

Currently being studied for the treatment of chronic severe gout, the drug candidate shows great promise.  Chronic severe gout presents itself as a high burden of inflammatory nodules of crystalized uric acid (tophi) that have no response to current medications.  This often leads to debilitating flares, gouty arthritis, and a low quality of life.  SEL-212 aids the drug being administer in conjunction by avoiding adverse reactions due to immunogenicity. 

Recently the company presented expanded data from patients receiving up to 0.15 mg/kg of SVP Rapamycin with 0.2/0.4 mg/kg of pegsiticase from its Phase 2 trial of SEL-212, designed to be the first non-immunogenic version of uricase.  The data reported that patients receiving three monthly doses of SEL-212 up to 0.15 mg/kg of SVP-Rapamycin in combination with 0.2/0.4 mg/kg of pegsiticase, followed by two monthly doses of pegsiticase alone.  Roughly 81% of evaluable patients (n=27) had serum uric acid control below 6 mg/dL at week 12, which indicates a great response in bringing patients down to normal uric acid levels which range up to 6.0 mg/dL for females and 7.0 mg/dL for males.  Gout is typically defined as a serum uric acid concentration above 7 mg/dL.  Comparatively, in a separate study of the only FDA-approved uricase therapy, 44% of evaluated patients had serum uric acid control below the 6 mg/dL benchmark at week 16.  27% of all current patients in the SEL-212 Phase II trial experienced gout flares during the first month after treatment with continued reduction of gout flare rates over months two to five.  This represents a massive decrease in gout flare ups when compared to the FDA-approved product for uricase.  

The previous data almost concretely demonstrated SEL-212’s potential ability to change the chronic severe gout treatment paradigm by providing better and more sustained serum uric acid control, fewer flares, and less frequent dosing compared retrospectively to the only FDA-approved product.  This upcoming data set has the potential to demonstrate the extended benefit of utilizing SEL-212 in chronic severe gout patients with high medical needs and pave the path to initiating the Phase III trial which is expected to start in Q4 of 2018.  

Phase II data is meant to represent safety of the drug candidate and to see if it is tolerable.  SEL-212 has been generally tolerable at clinically active doses following repeated administrations in the trial, with 17 serious adverse events, 9 of which were reported to not be related to the study drug, 8 were infusion reactions previously reported, and one was an infusion reaction.  No infusion reactions have been reported following the second treatment cycle and all serious adverse events were successfully treated. 


**Market and Competition:**

As previously mentioned, there is only one product on the market that is FDA-approved for uricase, which as the data above demonstrates is much inferior to the current data being presented for SEL-212.  There are over 8 million individuals in the US alone that have gout, with 160,000 suffering from chronic severe gout and are seen by rheumatologists.  Affecting their daily activities and quality of life, over 34% of individuals describe their flares as severe burns and 28% describe it as painful as breaking a bone.  Astonishingly, on average for patients under the age of 65 there are 25 lost work days each year due to lost productivity from severe gout flares.  

The market of gout therapeutics is going to boom in coming years.  Expected to reach a valuation of $8.3 billion by 2025 and growing at a CAGR of 16.1%, the treatment of SEL-212 shows promise to take hold of a massive share in the market.  The market growth is attributed to the major urate-lowering agents, approval of effective biologics, and increasing number of individuals suffering from chronic gout.  Currently because of the lack of effective treatments, Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents (NSAIDs) accounted for the highest share of the market in 2015, which can be credited to highest penetration, higher demand due to low cost, and efficient pain relief.  With the biggest market currently in the US, we are expecting to see a boom in the Asian markets mostly due to increasing quality in health care and better diagnosis of the disease.

The biggest competition in the market includes most notably Horizon Pharma’s gout drug Krystexxa, but also Takeda, Novartis, Savient, AstraZeneca, GSK, Merck, Teijin, and Regeneron. 


**Finances:**

The company has been granted a buy rating with high price expectations by several groups.  This shows promise and great sentiment towards the stock, with their data it is likely they will see high share price in the near future.  The company is however financially stressing at this point.  Their products are all in early stages of development with the exception of the Phase II candidate.  Their chief medical officer also resigned this year with no explanation at the time, causing a bit of worry.  

Their second quarter financial results produced no revenues, down from Q2 2017 due to the company’s grants and collaborations.  Expenses increased by 30% YOY when you compare quarters, a value of $18.8 million for the quarter which resulted in a net loss of $0.84 per share and missing expectations by $0.16.  

As it stands, the company has $66.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and believes that this will be sufficient to fund operations through to Q3 2019.   The current operating plan accounts for funding in preparation for the planned Phase III clinical trial for SEL-212 and initial patient enrollment into a couple of Phase III clinical trial sites, but the company will require an additional equity offering or other external sources of capital to expand enrollment in the Phase III trial and to conduct the planned head-to-head trial against Krystexxa.


**Review:**

This company has a promising pipeline and drug.  The data from the SEL-212 trials so far is incredible when compared to the market competition.  Selecta has several great collaborations with their candidate drugs and has presented almost nothing but good data.  They are making strides in markets that are in demand and have no effective or proper treatments for patients.  They fill an unmet need that will demand a market presence.  

However, beware.  The company is currently in a financial rut, with funds to push operations through for not even the next year, DILUTION IS IMMENENT.  The company will need to raise capital by completing an offering in order to fund their Phase III trials.  I would be absolutely weary of a dilution coming within days of positive news mid October when they present their updated Phase II data.  It would be the perfect time to complete an offering during high investor sentiment as it shows promise and will draw in new investor base. 




#**TLDR**

They are strapped for cash, can only 3 more quarters, will be diluting very soon probably October / November.  I have a FOMO knowing this is a good company &amp; pipeline and that the share price is low from last years over reaction to decent SEL-212 data causing a 50% drop and they did jump over 15% yesterday, but I will still wait. Unpredictable here, up about 30% the past month on expectations, they will get crushed by a dilution and present a perfect buying opportunity.

0,4250,"My take on $PLUG power, near and long term tendies, DD inside","**TLDR**: Buy $PLUG $3 11/16 calls for tendies as Plug Power will see the results of opening new factory, developing robots to take advantage of autonomous forklifts and delivery trucks, and developing new tech to double power storage. $AMZN, $NKE, and $WMT already use their equipment (and will purchase more) and $FDX has conducted 7500mi of deliveries in the Albany area using a Plug Power powered FedEx truck.

&amp;#x200B;

**DD**:

WSB listen up - Plug power is going to pop soon with a price target of $3.57, a 90% increase over its current price for the near term tendies. It will increase over the next quarter further as it completes its transition from research company to viable manufacturing company. I have 155 $3 11/16 calls for the near term tendies based around its 11/8 earning report, which I'll then turn over to 3/15 calls for the long term tendies where I expect it will jump yet further.

Walmart, Amazon, Nike, and FedEx have opened contracts with Plug Power for hydrogen powered forklifts and vehicles. Hydrogen power might seem lame but their niche is in industrial forklifts and local deliveries where time spent recharging is thousands of dollars a minute. Their CEO Andy Marsh has also been named to the U.S. Department of Energy Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technical Advisory Committee, giving the business the political connections it needs to succeed. Jonathan Silver, a member of the board of directors, is also a former US Department of Energy official. They are also pursuing European expansion to become an international company, where the political connections will offer them an advantage over their competitor Bloom Energy.

All eight of the board members have purchased hundreds of thousands of shares in the company four times since the beginning of the year, most recently in late August, signalling that they see a positive future for the company as it has turned around from a research company to a viable industrial and manufacturing business. Institutional investors have increased their stakes by millions of shares - Odey Asset Management Group Ltd bough an additional 2,330,000 shares increasing their stake in the company to 4,910,000 shares. Ignore the misleading title of the article and read content for a breakdown of the institutional investor increases: ([https://www.fairfieldcurrent.com/2018/09/23/insider-selling-plug-power-inc-nasdaqplug-director-sells-31343-shares-of-stock.html](https://www.fairfieldcurrent.com/2018/09/23/insider-selling-plug-power-inc-nasdaqplug-director-sells-31343-shares-of-stock.html))

This is also different than a vehicle running on LPG or other alternative fuel. The hydrogen isn't burned in the traditional sense, but is instead run through a membrane that strips the electrons from hydrogen using a catalyst and generates electricity directly from the reaction - the hydrogen then bonds with available oxygen and generates water as a byproduct. The advantage of this type of system is the reduced refueling/recharging time compared to traditional electric forklifts that are used in warehouses, and the reduced emissions compared to traditionally powered forklifts. Their systems are retrofit-capable and can be fitted to currently owned electric forklifts, reducing the overhead of purchasing all-new equipment.

They have also in-sourced the production of the membrane electrode assemblies to further reduce costs ([https://www.gasworld.com/interview-with-plug-power-ceo/2015463.article](https://www.gasworld.com/interview-with-plug-power-ceo/2015463.article)) and opened a new almost 40k SQFT factory in Rochester New York ([https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/08/15/plug-power-adds-factory-in-clifton-park](https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/08/15/plug-power-adds-factory-in-clifton-park)). They used to purchase their membranes for their equipment from their competitor Bloom Energy, and now that they are producing their own membranes they have announced two new pieces of technology - a new membrane that doubles the energy output of its fuel cell system. They have also partnered with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the US DOE to develop a robotic fueling station and reduces the time needed to refuel and allows the the usage of autonomous warehouse equipment powered by its system.

**Sector is down, except for CavCo**  
Residential construction, this quarter, [has been down](https://imgur.com/p0JBobo). Only three companies, $AVHI, $CVCO, and $CHCI are up YTD. $CHCI is only a $10M company with very little information available. $AVHI is likely to be acquired by a larger company, spiking its price. $CVCO is a **tank** with a P/E of 35, while the rest of the sector sits below 16. They are the exception to the rule.  
Every other company is struggling, ranging from -5% to -56% YTD, with $KBH at -20%.

**KBH up vs. this time last year**  
KBH is still up 22% from this time last year. Meaning- there's still room to fall. In fact, from 2014 until 2017 they very rarely [got above $20](https://imgur.com/4bBl5yb).  
I think they struggled to sell houses this quarter. [House price index is astronomical in the West](https://imgur.com/Epm6hbR), where KBH has substantial holdings and is expect an ""ending community count to be up slightly compared to 2017, including a year-over-year increase of approximately 15% in our West Coast homebuilding reporting segment."" Despite [a 21% year-over-year drop in communities](https://imgur.com/LNril48) in that region.

Some believe that KBH will get in on rebuilding after the Hurricane, but their resources are heavily invested in the West Coast. I think guidance will lower when the West Coast backlog grows going into Q4, and then the annual report will bring them back to a reasonable valuation. P/E should be around 8.0-8.1, which would price them around $19 after their annual report.

My position are $25p 10/19 and $23p 10/19s, because they're cheap and I'd love to get in on a big dip.",2018-09-25 14:29:33,"['AVHI', 'CVCO', 'CHCI', 'CHCI', 'AVHI', 'CVCO', 'KBH']"

0,4283,$PFE $ARTS $PRTK,"PFE: Treats form of non-small lung cancer (Drug: DACOMITINIB), Expected: **EOM**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85 percent of lung cancer cases and remains difficult to treat, particularly in the metastatic setting. Biomarker therapies dramatically changed the care of patients with metastatic NSCLC. Approximately 75 percent of NSCLC patients are diagnosed late with metastatic or advanced disease where the five-year survival rate is only five percent.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“What is most encouraging about these results is that patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR-activating mutations who received dacomitinib achieved a median overall survival of nearly three years, a marked improvement compared to an established treatment in this setting,” said Mace Rothenberg, MD, chief development officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “With today’s podium presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Priority Review granted earlier this year, we are encouraged by these data and committed to deliver this promising investigational medicine to patients as quickly as possible.”   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In April 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted priority review for dacomitinib for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations. The FDA Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date is in September 2018. The European Medicines Agency also accepted the Marketing Authorization Application for dacomitinib for the same indication. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

ARTS: Testosterone Deficiency (Drug: XYOSTED), Expected:  **September 29, 2018**. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Antares received a complete response letter for Xyosted that did not cite any questions relating to efficacy, manufacturing, quality control or the device used to deliver testosterone. Surprisingly, the FDA raised concerns that Xyosted could cause a clinically meaningful increase in blood pressure and might also be linked to depression and suicidality.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**The FDA Unexpectedly Responded to the NDA Resubmission with Lightning Speed; this is Highly Positive**  
&gt;  
&gt;In December 2017, Antares prepared for and requested a type A meeting with the FDA to discuss the CRL: this took place on February 21; 2018. The Company described the meeting as cordial. Antares announced on March 27, that it had received the official minutes on the type A meeting with the FDA. The Company said that based upon this that it believed that it would not need to conduct any new clinical studies to resubmit the NDA for Xyosted. At the time, Antares said that it expected to refile the NDA in 2Q, 2018. FDA guidelines mandate that the FDA respond within 30 days to determine whether the filing constitutes a complete response that addresses all deficiencies in the CRL.  
&gt;  
&gt;On April 5, 2018 Antares announced that the FDA acknowledged receipt of the resubmission to the Complete Response Letter (CRL) which Antares had submitted on March 29, 2018, earlier than the earlier guidance of a second quarter resubmission. Moving with unaccustomed speed, the FDA said that it considered this resubmission a complete, class 2 response and assigned a PDUFA date of September 29, 2018. The FDA had 30 days to consider the resubmission and my experience is that if the FDA has 30 or whatever days to respond, it invariably uses the full amount of time. It is out of character to respond in just eight days. This acceptance also takes away the risk and uncertainty that a new trial would be required.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Key Conclusions**  
&gt;  
&gt;This quick action by Antares in resubmitting the NDA just two days after receiving minutes of the type A meeting and the FDA accepting the filing as complete just eight days later is very positive.

**Overview:**

Aveo Pharmaceuticals (Aveo Oncology, for some reason they have one name for their company and one for their website) is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing targeted treatments for oncology and other unmet medical needs.  The company has a flagship product tivozanib, a compound that not only provides a long half-life, but servers as an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor 1, 2, and 3 receptors as a treatment for renal cell carcinoma and other types of cancers.  With several partnerships in the works, the company is leveraging their position to develop and commercialize their pipeline which already has traction in Europe.

The CEO, Michael Bailey, has been with Aveo for eight years originally coming in as the company’s chief commercial officer, then served as chief business officer in 2013.  In 2015, Bailey took the position of chief executive officer and president of the company.  Prior to being at Aveo, Bailey worked at executive level positions at Synta, ImClone Systems (now Eli Lilly), and SmithKline Beecham, where he helped market and commercialize drugs such as ERBITUX, CYRAMZA, and necitumumab.  With more than 20 years of experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry and experience in commercializing drugs in the oncology space, Bailey brings a solid track record to the table to help advance the company he runs. 

Aveo Pharmaceuticals has 6 different candidates in their pipeline with a total of 10 combined indications of use.  This robust pipeline is headed by their flagship product, Tivozanib.  With three different indications, tivozanib has been approved in Europe as a first line treatment in patients with RCC (renal cell carcinoma) as well as for adult patients who are vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease progression after one treatment with cytokine therapy for advanced RCC.


**Pipeline:**

With their six different products boasting a total of 10 different indications combined, Aveo shows great promise.  Their lead candidate is tivozanib, which has 3 current indications of which 1 is already approved in the EU since August 2017.  With an already proven treatment and potential for more, it is hard not to get excited about the potential with tivozanib.  The remainder of the company’s pipeline is still very early stage of the development process ranging from Preclinical to Phase III.  They have two different sectors that they break their products down into, Oncology and Non-Oncology.

**Oncology**

Tivozanib:

*TIVO-1 – 1st Line RCC (Approved)

*TIVO-3 – US Phase III Registration Study in 3rd Line RCC (Phase III)

*TiNivo – +Opdivo RCC (Phase II)


Ficlatuzumab:

*SCCHN (Investigator) (Phase II)

*Pancreatic (Investigator) (Phase I)

*AML (Investigator) (Phase I)


AV-203:

*Esophageal Cancer (Phase 1)


**Non-Oncology**

Ocular Form:

*AMD (Preclinical)

AV-308:

*Cachexia (Preclinical)

AV-353

*PAH (Preclinical)


While they do have a robust and outstanding pipeline, we want to turn our focus towards tivozanib as they will be presenting Phase II data at the ESMO this coming October.  This data is representing the TiNivo trial of tivozanib and nivolumab (Opdivo) in aRCC, as an immune checkpoint, PD-1, inhibitor.


**Specific Drug:**

Tivozanib is an oral, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which is approved for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC in the EU.  This potent inhibitor features a long half life which is selective of all three VEGF receptors and is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities.  This essentially makes the compound more efficient and potentially less toxic while requiring minimal dose modifications.   In the US, tivozanib is being investigated in a Phase II trial in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Opdivo (nivolumab) in RCC.  Tivozanib’s distinct tolerability among VEGF TKI’s creates a unique situation where it is a prime candidate to use alongside PD-1 inhibitors.  

The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway plays a significant role in angiogenesis, which is critical in cancer. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is essential for endothelial cell proliferation, migration and survival. There are five known VEGF ligands (A, B, C, D, PLGF) and three VEGF receptors (1, 2 and 3). Each ligand exhibits distinct but overlapping binding profiles for the three VEGF receptors.


To optimally inhibit the VEGF pathway, it may be critical to effectively block all three VEGF receptors as each plays an important role in cancer angiogenesis:

VEGF receptor 1 is critical for the modulation of endothelial cell survival and vessel morphogenesis;

VEGF receptor 2 is thought to be the predominant receptor for endothelial cell proliferation and migration; and,

VEGF receptor 3 promotes endothelial sprouting and vascular network formation.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated tivozanib is a potent, selective, long half-life inhibitor of all three VEGF receptors that is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities.


With that overview done on the drug, lets dive a little deeper into this.

TKIs have recently revolutionized the treatment of RCC while inhibitors of VEGF pathways have become the standard treatment option for patients with RCC.  Tivozanib is a novel VEGF receptor TKI inhibitor which has demonstrated antitumor efficacy.  The unique selectivity of tivozanib has shown minimal off-target toxicities and prevented many adverse effects.  Also, VEGFR TKIs have shown modulation of antitumor immunity, providing synergy between VEGFR and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibition, showing tivozanib to enhance PD-1 activity through regulatory T-cell reduction.  

When tivozanib was compared to competitors axitinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, and sunitinib, only tivozanib and sunitinib significantly reduced the percentage of regulatory T cells.  Where P = % CD4/CD25/FoxP3 (all regulatory T Cells analyzed by flow cytometry), the drugs produced the following results 16 hours after last TKI application.

Tivozanib – P = 0.034

Axitinib – P=0.908

Pazopanib – P=0.354

Sorafenib – P=0.427

Sunitinib – P=0.002


As you can see, only tivozanib and sunitinib showed a significant reduction in regulator T cells.  However, due to the specify of tivozanib, its unique adverse effect profile makes it an ideal candidate for combination therapies.

The Phase II study of TiNivo is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerable dose of tivozanib in combination with nivolumab in patients with RCC.  All patients are over 18 that present RCC, which is a measurable disease, and have no prior exposure to tivozanib or nivolumab with a life expectancy greater than 3 months.  Patients of the study received tivozanib QD for 21 days, followed by a rest period of 7 days, and nivolumab intravenously 240 mg Q2W.  Dose of tivozanib included 1.0 mg QD and 1.5 mg QD.   Phase II was an expansion of cohorts of maximum tolerated dose enrolled patients to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of tivozanib. 

In Phase I, no patients experienced dose limiting toxicity in cycle 1 (4 weeks) and MTD was determined to be full-dose tivozanib 1.5mg/d + nivolumab 240 mg.  In Phase II, an additional 21 patients were enrolled at MTD on top of the Phase I 6 patients.  In Phase II, a total of 6 patients discontinued tivozanib and 7 discontinued nivolumab, and there was 1 dose reduction for tivozanib (cycle 6 or 24 weeks in) and a total of 17 dose interruptions. 

For safety, 14 (51.9%) of patients experienced 1 or more grade 3 or 4 adverse effect of any cause.  Nearly half of the adverse effects that were experienced could have potentially been immune-related adverse effects rather than an adverse effect of the compound itself.  These include rash, pruritus, increased ALT, increased amylase, increased AST, increase lipase, sarcoidosis, and diarrhea.  The most common adverse effect was hypertension, but the mean age for patients was 63. 

Preliminary Antineoplastic Activity and preliminary efficacy was assessed in 14 patients who started therapy at MTD and had 2 or more treatment scans, being on treatment for 4 months or greater.  Of the 14, 11 are undergoing treatment including 3 in cycle 8 with a partial response.  The results showed that of the 14 patients, none had seen a complete response, 9 (64.3%) saw a partial response, and 5 (35.7%) showed stable disease with no progression.  No patients displayed progressive disease.  The charts indicate that patients who have been treated for 24 or more weeks almost all saw some partial response, giving the potential that extended treatment will generate a response.  

Although preliminary, the results of the data indicated before a 64% response rate and a 100% disease control rate in patients receiving the MTD suggesting promising antitumor efficacy.  This data demonstrates efficacy for tivozanib in combination with PD-1 inhibitors.  The updated Phase II data to be presented in October of 2018 will hopefully affirm these numbers and show greater response rates and no disease progression in all patients. 


**Current Market:**

RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, accounting for 90-95% of malignant neoplasms involving the kidneys.  It is estimated that over 63,000 cases of new kidney cancer will occur in the United States and over 14,000 individuals will die because of it.  According to Grand View Research, the global kidney cancer drug market was valued at $4.4 billion in 2016, and expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.4%.  Incidence of RCC is highest in North America and Western Europe.  Globally, there are an estimated 270,000 new cases diagnosed each year and over 116,000 deaths because of RCC.

While previously the treatment for kidney cancer was simply removing the kidney, various forms of treatment methods have been implemented among the currently approved drugs, including immune modulation therapy, cytokine therapy, mTOR inhibitor, and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitor.

Rising preference for novel immunotherapies and immune-oncologic agents will push the use of targeted therapies to specific patient subpopulations or later lines of treatment. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors are poised to displace TKIs and mTOR inhibitors as the standard of care in first-and second-line RCC settings. Combination regimens, specifically those including PD-1 inhibitors will be introduced in the first-line setting to target major unmet needs, giving Aveo a prime opportunity to grab a large share of the market treatment.

Competition in the space includes major companies such as; Amgen/Allergan, Argos Therapeutics, AstraZeneca, Aveo Pharmaceuticals, Bayer, Exelixis, Incyte, Merck, and Roche.

PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors represent a paradigm shift in kidney cancer treatment. Several PD-1 and PD-L1 agents with novel therapies are in early development and are being evaluated both as monotherapy and in combination with already approved immuno-oncology agents.  Again, another position that Aveo has an opportunity to shine in.


**Financials:**

Recently, Aveo ended Q2 2018 with $18.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated a total revenue of $0.4 million, the same revenue amount generated the same quarter last year.  Expenses have gone down in R&amp;D and administrative combined.  With a net income of $4.0 million for Q2 2018, the company posted an income of $0.03 per basic share and a loss of -$0.06 per diluted share, which compares to a -$0.30 loss per basic share Q2 2017.  Approximately $11.1 million of Q2 2018 net income was due to the decrease in value of the 2016 warrants which resulted from the decrease in stock price in the quarter.  The company believes that the $18.1 million will fund operations into the first quarter of 2019.  With a market cap of just under $400 million, this small company is going to look to raise funds soon to continue funding their trials, resulting in an upcoming dilution.  


**Review:**

I like this company a lot.  They have a drug in a large, unmet market that is developing and going to grow fairly rapidly.  With an already approved indication and several more products in their pipeline, I believe they will see success.  The data in Phase I showed promise and building off the safety and efficacy of Phase II I believe the additional cohorts put in will bring about positive data in favor of the drug showing specificity and low toxicity.  Having already demonstrated not a single progression in disease, it is unlikely we will see progression moving forward, and we will start to see partial responses from more patients.  

I do expect a dilution in the coming two months, however they did just gain value from the warrant situation, creating an opportunity for the company to take advantage and present a dilution to raise funds to continue operations for the next year or two.  Their burn rate is pretty high but that should be assumed due to their pipeline and stages of development.  The stock has been trading up the past 2 months, almost doubling its low since July.  Although, I have no issue buying below $3.50 for a long term hold.


#**TLDR**

This stock has rocketed up, almost doubling since a low in July, but really just getting back up to support zones around $3.  I think under $3.50 is a buy, they need to dilute to raise cash soon so expect an offering, but with warrants expiring from 2016 and freeing up a bunch of debt the company is in a good spot to do an offering.  I dont see a short term play here, but I do see a long term hold of 1+ year for a solid gain if you are looking for a small company, big bet to add to your portfolio.

&amp;#x200B;

Following this [link](http://www.trevena.com/trevena-pipeline.php) you can find the company's current pipeline. The drug in question is TRV130 Oliceridine. 

&amp;#x200B;

"" Oliceridine injection was designed to optimize opioid receptor pharmacology using Trevena’s proprietary platform to deliver an improved analgesic profile compared to conventional intravenous (IV) opioids. Oliceridine injection is the first G Protein-Biased Ligand at the μ-opioid receptor, and is in development for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain where IV therapy is preferred. 

&amp;#x200B;

 In February 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy status to oliceridine injection. This designation is granted by the FDA to new therapies intended to treat serious conditions and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial clinical improvement over available therapies. In January, 2018, we announced that FDA has accepted the oliceridine injection new drug application for review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act review date of November 2, 2018. ""

&amp;#x200B;

It is a lengthy read so here is the summary. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Results: Two hundred patients were treated (n=39, n=39, n=83, and n=39 in the oliceridine regimen A, oliceridine regimen B, morphine, and placebo groups, respectively). Patients were predominantly female (n=198 \[99%\]) and had a mean age of 38.2 years, weight of 71.2 kg, and baseline pain score of 7.7 (on 11-point numeric pain rating scale). Patients receiving the oliceridine regimens had reductions in average pain scores (model-based change in time-weighted average versus placebo over 24 hours) of 2.3 and 2.1 points, respectively (P=0.0001 and P=0.0005 versus placebo); patients receiving morphine had a similar reduction (2.1 points; P&lt;0.0001 versus placebo). A lower prevalence of adverse events (AEs) related to nausea, vomiting, and respiratory function was observed with the oliceridine regimens than with morphine (P&lt;0.05). Other AEs with oliceridine were generally dose-related and similar in nature to those observed with conventional opioids; no serious AEs were reported with oliceridine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion: These results suggest that oliceridine may provide effective, rapid analgesia in patients with moderate to severe postoperative pain, with an acceptable safety/tolerability profile and potentially wider therapeutic window than morphine.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Also another lengthy read. 

&amp;#x200B;

 The analgesic efficacy of TRV130 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain was achieved without SAEs. Although proof of concept was demonstrated for analgesic efficacy, robust tolerability comparisons were limited by dosing methodology and modest sample size, and future studies are needed to continue to assess tolerability. These results also suggest CU for TRV130 at different points on the dose-response curve: Higher doses may provide previously unachieved reductions in pain intensity in clinical scenarios that require greater analgesia, with dose reduction as an option to preserve sufficient analgesia with fewer ORAEs than experienced with conventional opioids.

&amp;#x200B;

 In summary, this study demonstrated TRV130 analgesic efficacy in patients experiencing moderate-to-severe acute pain in a bunionectomy model. In-study comparisons to morphine suggest that G-protein-biased m-opioid receptor activation may enable increased efficacy with acceptable tolerability vs conventional opioids.

Now looking at older posts of $TRVN it seems like it hasn't been performing too hot. There haven't a whole lot of posts regarding this company in the past year. The most recent one was 3 days ago. Mentions of morphine being cheaper than this drug doesn't look like good news. It's going up against something which has been a staple in the medical community for many years.

0,4392,Making Money from Addiction," 

Greetings fellow Autists. This is my first DD submission so I’ll keep in brief. 

TL;DR, 2 drugs related to opioid epidemic up for Adcom mid-Oct and FDA Approval early Nov.  I focus on Trevena ($TRVN) here. You may also be interested in ($ACRX). FYI the DoD is a big fan of $ACRX drug which is a lozenge they can use on battlefield. FDA has said they will take into account DoD objectives when approving drugs.  

Both are up significantly in the past month but have room to rise before Adcom. I believe these are multi-bagger plays but can’t predict their performance on the two major catalysts. Been a lot of selling on good news in biotech lately (or so i’ve been told always).  

Trevena closed at 2.17. It fluxed between 1.57-1.80 a bunch before rising last week and continuing to inch up with minor retracement.

I’m not going to pretend to know how these drugs actually work. I won’t even pretend to understand the market. My model portfolio is a rotating mash up of WSB DD from first time posters.

I do however know a few things about the FDA, CMS (Medicare / Medicaid) and the NIH (I used acronyms here to further demonstrate my expertise). I’ve had things approved by FDA, paid for by CMS and granted money for study by NIH so I’m reasonably attuned to changes and opportunities in these overlapping sectors of gov. 

Specifically I (and you) know that the **Opioid epidemic is a big deal.** Its such a big deal that the House passed a bill this week with special focus on funding to develop non-opioid alternatives to treat pain. The money in the bill isn’t huge but its a big **signal to other agencies like NIH and FDA to get their shit together and fast track the development and approval of drugs.**  

**Trevena ($TRVN) - Drug Name Olivo; Oliceridine (TRV-130).**

**Adcom: Oct. 12**

**FDA Decision: By Nov. 2**

Oliceridine is a “G protein-biased MOR small-molecule agonist that has been shown to exert analgesia with less respiratory depression and constipation than morphine.”  

Why its better than Morphine:

TRV-130 (Oliceridine) was comparable to IV opioids at pain reduction, but lower for vomiting, respiratory events (a big deal, people die because they just stop breathing), upper GI tolerability and constipation.  

**Why I think it will be approved:**

1. **Doctors seem to love this drug.** That is a big deal, to be approved it needs to basically be safe (or slightly safer than something thats not very safe) and have an actual demand from doctors who would utilize it. This seems to be two big thumbs up.
2. **The National Institute on Drug Abuse is studying an oral version of Oliceridine (TRV-734) as a potentially differentiated therapy for maintenance treatment of opioid dependence.** 
   1. **They are so hot on this drug they want to make an oral version to give to addicts instead of methadone.**
   2. PO: 75N95018P00541 Aug 29, 2018 if interested in reading.
3. **The Donald has his small but mighty fist on the scales of the FDA.** By swapping out career FDA folks for his flavor of sycophants he has increased the rate of drug approvals during his administration, making 2017 a record year. 2018 is off to a rocking start again. Now is the golden age of slamming shitty drugs through the FDA. This one isn’t shit so by that logic its a slam dunk.  

I have a big night of being cuckolded ahead of me so I’ll close here. If people are interested I will dig in further on this and on $ACRX.  Bring on the hate. Would also be cool to learn how to play this situation better.  I feel solid on the macro dynamics but not the micro trading strategy.

*BIIB098 (Formerly ALKS 8700) – Phase III for Multiple Sclerosis

*ALKS 4230 – Phase I in Immuno-oncology


Alkermes has two big FDA deadlines and events in the upcoming months which will be the focus of this write up.  The first is ALKS 5461 for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder with the FDA advisory committee discussing the NDA application for the drug candidate on November 1st as well as a PDUFA date of January 31, 2019.  The second is ALKS 4230 for treatment of Solid Tumors, where they are reporting Phase I initial data in the second half of 2018.  I will be setting 2 dates for this write up to remind investors of the Advisory Meeting/data presentation sometime in the next 2 months, as well as the PDUFA date of January 31, 2019.  With multiple catalysts in the pipeline in the next 3 months, Alkermes is an exciting company to watch.


**Specific Drugs:**

**ALKS 5461**

AKLS 5461, buprenorphine/samidorphan, is a k-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist which functions as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy in treatment-resistant depression (TRD).  The buprenorphine is a partial agonist of µ-opioid receptors (MOR), antagonist of the KOR, as well as a slight antagonist of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR), and a weak agonist of the nociception receptor (NOP).  Samidorphan on the other hand is a preferential antagonist of the MOR, allowing for the combination of the two to function as a stopper to KORs with negligible activation of MORs.  
Essentially this means that by activating the KOR, opioid peptides which are endogenous ligands of the KOR and function by inversing morphine-like, euphoric endorphins, create a sense of dysphoria and psychotomimetic effects, and are to produce changes in neuroplasticity evoked by chronic stress that has led to the development of depression and CNS disorders and drug addiction.  It is suggested in research that inhibiting the KOR abolishes antidepressant-like effects of buprenorphine, but the drug exhibits both antagonistic and agonist properties.  This has led to the concern that in theory, ALKS-5461 could be limited in the effectiveness of treatment of depression.  

Granted a Fast Track Designation in 2013, the drug has proceeded up to Phase III where thee different trials were initiated for the treatment of depression.  The first two trials failed in 2016, FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, however based on the third trial, FORWARD-5, the company submitted an NDA in 2017 for ALKS-5461.  Things started to look grim for the company moving forward, as the FDA served Alkermes a refuse-to-file letter saying that more data from well-controlled clinical trials must be presented before an application would be recognized.  However, just two weeks after serving the notice, the FDA rescinded their letter and accepted the NDA after productive interactions with Alkermes where the company clarified certain aspects of the NDA.  No further data was needed to rescind the letter and PDUFA date is scheduled by January 31, 2019.

The first two trials failed after the company reported higher placebo responses as the chief obstacle in their studies.  Not something a company would like to hear in relation to an antidepressant medication.  Causing the stock to plummet 44% in 2016, from nearly $80 to under $40, the company has been slowly recovering since.  ALKS-5461’s fate lies in the hands of FORWARD-5, without a clear success and perfect data, an FDA approval seems unlikely for this drug. 

FORWARD-5 focused on two doses of 1mg/1mg and 2mg/2mg of ALKS-5461 for adjunct treatment in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).  Concurrently to taking ALKS-5461, the patients also remained on background antidepressant therapy.  With 407 patients enrolled, 63 received 1mg/1mg, 63 received 2mg/2mg, and 280 received the placebo.  The study was conducted in two stages: Stage 1 was 5 weeks, Stage 2 was 6 weeks. In Stage 1, the average change from baseline depression scores was calculated for weeks 3 through 5. For Stage 2, the average change was calculated for weeks 3 through 6. Depression scores were assessed using the 6-item Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-6) and MADRS-10, an assessment tool for depression.

In the study, ALKS-5461 2mg/2mg met the prespecified primary endpoint of significantly reducing depression scores compared to placebo, as measured by 6-item MADRS scores (p=0.018). ALKS-5461 2mg/2mg also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in 10-item MADRS scores compared to placebo (p=0.026). The 1mg/1mg dose of ALKS-5461 showed improvement in depressive symptoms in the study, but did not separate significantly from placebo.  2mg/2mg treatment did show a significant change, warranting its efficacy while also having no incidences of withdrawal or pattern of adverse effects suggesting abuse potential.  The clinical benefit of the compound maintained through 11-week study and the compound is relatively safe and tolerable.  Where FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4 failed to meet their endpoints, FORWARD-5 succeed in meeting primary endpoint for the 2mg/2mg dose, showing great efficacy when compared to a placebo.   
November 1st, 2018, the FDA advisory committee is meeting to discuss ALKS-5471 in relation to the compound’s efficacy, safety and risk-benefit profile of the NDA for buprenorphine and samidorphan sublingual tablets for adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder.  In recent history, the FDA has gone against the decision and vote of the advisory committee roughly 10% of the time over all, with 30% of the votes being against approving the drug and 70% of the votes being for approval.  

**ALKS-4230**

Currently in Phase I of development, Alkermes does a change of pace with this immuno-oncology drug for the treatment of solid tumors, making a shift away from their regular market in the CNS disease space.  This drug candidate is an engineered fusion protein comprised of permuted interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2 Receptor (IL-2R) α made specifically to only activate the intermediate-affinity IL-2R.  The intermediate-affinity IL-2R is expressed mainly on effector lymphocytes, which are essential in generating an antitumor immune response.  IL-2 is a cell signaling molecule which plays a role in controlling the life cycle of specialized T-cells.  ALKS-4230 selectively binds to intermediate-affinity IL-2R to both activate and increase in number the immune cells that work to battle cancer.  Their selectivity, however, means they don’t bind to the “high-affinity IL-2 receptor,” so as not to trigger greater activity or proliferation in immune cells that could dampen an anti-tumor response Research has suggested that selective activation of the intermediate-affinity IL-2R by ALKS-4230 has the potential to provide enhanced tumor killing as well as improved tolerability. 
ALKS-4230 is currently in Phase I in patients with advanced solid tumors. Key study objectives are to determine a recommended phase 2 dose and characterize the safety profile, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and evidence of antitumor activity. A dose-escalation phase in patients with refractory solid tumors (Part A) will be followed by expansion cohorts in defined populations (Part B). ALKS 4230 is administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion once daily for five days each cycle. The dose will be escalated until reaching maximum tolerated dose or an Optimal Biologic Dose. The first two dose cohorts will use a 3+3 design. Subsequent cohorts in Part A will enroll a minimum of 6 subjects. In Part B up to 21 patients will be enrolled into each of four tumor-specific cohorts. Peripheral blood samples will be collected for PK, immunogenicity and PD assessments. The primary PD endpoint is change-from-baseline in CD8+ T, NK and T reg cell counts. Other PD measures include serum concentrations of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and immunohistochemical assessment of markers of immune activation in tumor tissue from selected patients. 

Animal trials conducted previously were positive and showed the anti-tumor activity of ALKS-4230, both alone and with the checkpoint inhibitors. Rodents treated with ALKS-4230 were seen to have lesser tumor growth and better survival, supporting clinical evaluation of ALKS 4230 as a potential immunotherapy in the oncology space. ALKS-4230 will be administered in combination with PD-1 inhibitor KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab). Pembrolizumab is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells, complimenting the mechanisms of action from ALKS-4230.  Alkermes has accelerated clinical evaluation of ALKS 4230 in combination with pembrolizumab based on data from the ongoing monotherapy dose-escalation stage of the phase 1 study, where ALKS 4230 demonstrated dose-dependent pharmacodynamic effects on circulating natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells, and minimal and non-dose dependent effects on immunosuppressive regulatory T cells.  

Initial data from Phase I is due in the second half of 2018, estimated to come out early November.


**Competition and Market:**

ALKS-4230 is a tough market, cancer is a hot sector but it continually sees failure.  While the FDA holds the stance that they want to try to push new oncology and immuno-oncology drugs through the approval process and get them to market to potentially save or extend lives, their decisions tend to skew otherwise.  Being so early on in development, it’s not necessary to dive into the market in depth as there is a large, unmet need in the oncology sector with the main focus being in immuno-oncology.

MDD has a multifaceted and varied etiology, and remains poorly understood. The MDD market is overly crowded and overly competitive, surpassing 30 FDA approved products available for the treatment of patients, the majority of which are now available as inexpensive generics. The MDD market is currently in an active transition where patents are expiring on top-selling products such as Eli Lilly's Cymbalta and Otsuka/BMS' Abilify, paving way for launches of Lundbeck/Takeda's Trintellix and Otsuka/Lundbeck's Rexulti.  These will create a significant growth in the market as cheaper generics will become available.  Growth in the MDD market is also expected to be driven by the potential introduction of numerous promising late-stage pipeline products into the market during the next few years which are directed at treatment-resistant patients.  These products include Alkermes' ALKS-5461, Allergan/Gedeon Richter/Mitsubishi Tanabe's Vraylar, Axsome Therapeutics' AXS-05, Janssen's esketamine, and Allergan's rapastinel.

MDD is the most common mental disorder in the U.S., affecting approximately 16 million American adults, of which about one-third remain untreated. The number of treated patients is projected to rise on account of expiring patents, the increase in available generic products, and rising awareness regarding depression and mental health issues.  This competitive market was priced at a massive $3.2 billion in 2015 and is expected to consistently grow at a CAGR of 6.1% until 2025 to reach $5.8 billion.  With the current social standings of mental health, students being required to take mandatory mental health courses now in many places, and social workers and therapists being more commonplace in schools and work places, we should see a larger surge in my opinion.  Growing female prevalence, increase in prescription spending, and escalating awareness of mental health will propel the growth of this market for many years to come.


**Financials:**

Alkermes has a great financial standing in the biotech industry.  Leveraging both their approved products and impressive collaborations, the company was able to boast a revenue growth of 39% ($304.6 million) through product sales and payments.  Many opportunities lined up for the company and set them up for success this second quarter. 

*Vivitrol sales increased 15% to $76.2 million

*Aristada sales increased 48% to $33.6 million

*Royalties from Johnson &amp; Johnson partnership increased 4% to $85.2 million

*Royalties from Acorda Therapeutics decreased 22% to $19.7 million

*License revenue from Biogen generated $48.3 million in revenue


Despite increased operation costs related to commercializing their products and further research and development, the company posted a Non-GAAP net income of $45.6 million and a Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.29. With a total cash balance of $561 million and total debt of $280 million, the company stands on strong ground.  This second half of 2018 has several catalysts, combined with increasing revenues from collaborations and drug approvals, Alkermes is likely to see success, only to be complimented by hopefully positive data from their upcoming Phase I and PDUFA dates. The company is expecting to hit $1 billion in revenues for 2018 as a year, which would be a massive milestone for the pharmaceutical company.


**Review:**

Historically, the FDA has been flexible with depression medications, but failures will weigh Alkermes down.  Depression studies have had a flurry of failures over recent history, and failure here can dissuade further research in the pharmaceutical space until more is known on the biology side.  With over 30 currently approved products on the market for MDD, it is overly saturated and failure can spell the end for the drug.  Following their failures in FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, investors are weary of another failure, especially after the initial NDA was rejected.  Good news is, there is an advisory committee meeting in November to discuss ALKS-5461. In recent history, the FDA has gone against the decision and vote of the advisory committee only about 10% of the time over all, with 30% of the votes being against approving the drug and 70% of the votes being for approval.  Chances are from that perspective that the FDA will grant approval.  The compound also shows no suggestion of tolerance of therapeutic effects, the side effect profile was generally comparable to standard medications with no significant late appearing side effects, and when medication was halted there was no sign of opioid withdrawal.  With the competitive, growing market and patents expiring, a new and novel MDD treatment would be a value add.

In the case of the early stage ALKS-4230, oncology drug candidates historically have a 57% possibility of success moving from Phase I to Phase II compared to an industry average of 63.2% possibility of success.  This does shine in comparison to the oncology end success rate of a low 3.4%.  If I were to put my money where my mouth is, I am going with the data and not the suggestive words of the FDA to say that oncology might sound like a great industry with the backing of the FDA, but their actions prove otherwise.  Oncology drugs are more likely to be denied by the FDA and fail their clinical trials at much higher rates than other industries such as vaccines which show an end rate of success over 30%.  I would guess this drug might make it to Phase III with time, but statistically it is unlikely to see approval.  While Phase III or even Phase II are years away from completion, the data in Phase I will likely reveal a lot about the drug to make future estimations off of.  I see Phase I being positive.

Currently the stock is trading around $43 and showing a high level of support and consolidation in this zone.  With a high of over $70 not 7 months ago, the company is likely to recover and soar.  This stock does not take bad news well however, seeing several 10% or more drops over the past year, but never going under $40 for long.  I think between $42-46 are great entries for this stock.  Long term their finances are growing, increasing revenues from royalties and sales of their own approved products, on track to hit $1 billion in revenues this year, and a solid pipeline that shows great promise.  I would bank on good data from ALKS-4230 as well as a positive hearing from the advisory committee.  With the PDUFA date in January, we will see a heavy run up into the end of the year.  I would take advantage of this price entry for either a long-term hold or a swing trade.  I would predict levels of up to $55 in the coming 3 months.  


#**TLDR**

So stock basically back to where it was a month ago. Why, because dis gold digging bitch (https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/cristiano-ronaldo-kathryn-mayorga-filmed-13366084, judge for yourself) sued CR7, and is causing reputational damage for Juventus. For a stock that trades on sentiment this is obviously not good.

However Juventus seems to be supporting CR7 (https://twitter.com/juventusfcen/status/1047912523494842370) so I don't think he will be dropped unless some real shit happens. 

On the pitch Juventus is destroying everybody, so fundamentally the team is doing well. More wins, more views, more merchandise, more money. That's basically the direction right now. I don't think the lawsuit will impact that, at least not yet.

Sold my near 10 bagger at its peak for less than a double (1.1 and 1.2 December warrants), and rolled it into 1.5 that was offering 7x based on my target of 2. If you are wondering how I made money that now I may lose on the 1.5s that's because IV shot through the roof. The eurofags pricing these literally just dialed it up from 30s to over 100 at one point. Now it's around 70.

Key events:

1. Lawsuit progress, so far CR7 is denying everything, hasn't gone all out war yet like suing back.
2. Winning more games
3. Earnings in November.

With pretty fuckin impressive drug data, they are presenting in early November.  They are in the NASH market, show data much better than many competitors, and there is no FDA approved drug to treat NASH.  They are in Phase II, the drug is being prepped for Phase III, and it has more than one indication that it is meeting all endpoints for while being safe and tolerable.

If it really was insider trading, then the pick of the 4.5 strike probably was not random. Earnings coming up and from what I've read takeover might happen before next earnings. Nov16 or Dec21 expirations look like the most promising.

The stock was 160 before this silly tech sell off and I believe that CRM Is basically irreplaceable for businesses, so this temporary pull back is prime time to get in there.

Buy now for like $148, stock likely pops on incredible guidance. Thinking north of $160 a share by end of November. 

Or be small now and wait till November 15th or so to size up. Who knows what happens to tech in the meanwhile.

The stock is extremely undervalued compared to its AUM growth which is going to continue to grow exponentially. I see the stock going to 40+ in a couple of months and even higher once its unrealized value in its current assets kicks in.

Accounting for the fact that they're on pace to hit 10,000 vehicles in 1H 2018, the steady state delivery rate would be closer to 35,000 vehicles/year; and those are very conservative growth rates. What's more, they will be able to support 100,000 annual units with existing manufacturing capabilities, so scaling isn't looking like an issue.

Current ARPU is ~$67,000, which puts them on track to produce ~$220 million in revenue this year. With a new lower cost vehicle launching next year, and a serious competitive price advantage over the Model X and S in China, I predict they'll produce over $1 billion in revenues for 2019.",2018-10-16 07:51:30,['NIO']

Guarantee you analysts will raise price targets tomorrow on the back of positive announcements at Signal conference. Pay partnership is with Stripe. Developers love Twilio

Stock has been hammered past two weeks due to global macro environment but fundamentals remain very strong

Twilio announced acquisition of sendgrid (leading email API platform) which basically rounds out the communications platform it offers. Email was the missing piece that people were wondering why Twilio doesn’t integrate and now they have it. Acquisition is via all-stock transaction. Despite this analysts remain bullish due to long term synergies and the fact that SendGrid userbase is different from Twilio’s which allows for cross selling opportunities 

Twilio build is a program for consulting/tech firms to help integrate Twilio with customers and spread awareness

Earnings date is scheduled for Nov 6 which is the day of the US house election. Twilio has developed an API for voting so there may be some parallels here between the two. 

Street Revenue estimates for Q3 aren’t even high and Twilio may blow past them given existing customers are spending more $ on increasing # of products 

TLDR: long TWLO calls expiring post earnings are the play here. Main risk is overall market selloff from worries around rising rates etc continuing causing tech shares to tumble further.  Twilio’s fundamentals are very strong and correction in past few weeks creates good buying opp. I also wrote a comment on here right before Q2 earnings predicting a major beat.

0,4650,$REV - Short Squeeze in the Making,"Through all the volatility in the marketplace, REV - on no positive news - has been posting steady gains day over day since the 5th. All in all a \~30% increase.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a well written [thesis](https://moxreports.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Long-Rev-Sep-2018-Final.pdf) explaining the dynamics at play. \~85% of the shares have been accumulated by Perelman with an intent to go private. The majority of remaining shares are owned by Mittleman Brothers LLC who have explictly expressed intent to refuse any go private offers that do not reflect the intrinsic value of the stock - which they place in the range of $50.

&amp;#x200B;

With the vast majority of share owned by players with no intent to sell, the amount of trade-able shares / float is exceedingly small and shrinking. 2.7 million shares are shorted with a daily volume \~250K. As the major players increase their share in advance of going private, and others buy and hold in anticipation of a tender offer, traded shares continues to shrink.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact that REV has continued to climb - from $20 on the 5th to $26 today without any signs of pullback despite a volatile market - underscores the extent price is being driven by these dynamics with the float. It would seem to be to Perelman's advantage to initiate a tender offer sooner, rather than later as this run-up increase. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is some threshold where a short squeeze will accelerate. With 30% sustained gains over the past two weeks, it is likely shorts covering positions are driving some of the existing movement already.

0,4805,$ARWR - Arrowhead Pharma DD,"Been a minute.  So here you go.  

Last month, shares of Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals (ARWR) saw a year to date growth in their share price of over 400%, increasing from $3.70 at the start of January to more than $19.00 at the end of September.  However, the stock saw a large pullback in early October due to misinterpreted data and actions by the company.  On October 4th, Arrowhead entered into a $3.7B license and collaboration agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson's (JNJ) Janssen Pharmaceuticals.  While I believe this deal is the best step forward for the company, the share price reflects an investor sentiment that Arrowhead got the short end of the stick on the deal and the company could profit more in the long run had they kept the global licensing for themselves.  

*The Deal*

Under the agreement, Arrowhead received a $175M upfront payment from Janssen and a $75M equity investment at a price of $23 per share from Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation.  The agreement also states Arrowhead has potential to receive an additional $3.5B in milestone payments, as well as further royalties on commercial sales from Janssen as they received the worldwide exclusive license for ARO-HBV with the ability to collaborate with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals on up to three new RNA interface (RNAI) therapeutics against targets.  The upfront payment, equity investments, and additional milestone payments combine to provide Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals a total potential value of over $3.7B.

Broken down, the company is eligible to receive up to roughly $1.6B in payments for the HBV license agreement with Janssen, which stipulates a $50M milestone payment linked to one of their Phase II studies. Additionally, Arrowhead is eligible to receive up to $1.9 billion in option and milestone payments for the RNAi collaboration agreement. Lastly, Arrowhead is eligible to receive royalties that extend up into the mid teens in relation to commercial sales down the road. 

While Arrowhead has potential for large payments down the road and attractive royalties, Janssen does hold the worldwide exclusive license to the ARO-HBV program, Arrowhead’s drug candidate for treating chronic hepatitis B infection. Conversely, Arrowhead’s ongoing study of ARO-HBV will be taken over by Janssen for clinical development and commercialization.  This is great news as the R&amp;D, commercialization, and marketing costs will solely fall into the hands of Janssen while Arrowhead receives royalties on the back end.  Further reducing costs, worked into the deal is the ability of Janssen to select up to three brand new targets for Arrowhead to develop clinical candidates for utilizing the TRiM™ platform. Arrowhead will perform all steps required for developing the drug candidates, but the process will be entirely funded by Janssen up until the point the company is prepared to file an IND application.  At this point, Janssen can choose whether or not to take exclusive licensing on the drug candidate, if not then Janssen will hold responsibility for further development and commercialization. 


*AASLD Liver Meeting Presentation*

On November 12th, 2018, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals is presenting late breaking data at the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) Liver Meeting in regards to their ARO-HBV and ARO-AAT Phase I studies.

*ARO-HBV* 

RNAi has indicated potential as a treatment option for patients with chronic hepatitis B based on its ability to silence HBV mRNA thereby reducing all viral products, most notably HBsAg.

Fortunately there were no serious adverse effects or dropouts in normal, healthy volunteers or patients with chronic hepatitis B reported to date. AEs were mild and similar in occurrence for active or placebo.  Results showed that patients (n=16) who received monthly doses x 3 of 100, 200, 300 or 400 mg of ARO-HBV, 14 were BLQ (HBV DNA was present but below the quantification limit) for HBV DNA and 13 were HBeAg negative at baseline.

All patients that reached day 85 in the study were shown to have &gt; 1.0 log10 reduction in HBsAg with additional HBsAg decreases observed after the second and third doses. Of the 24 Chronic Hepatitis B Patients (CHB):


21 had HBsAg &gt;100 IU/ml at baseline

17 have currently achieved HBsAg &lt;100

7 ≤10

4 ≤1

In CHB with other viral parameters all patients have improved following ARO-HBV treatments in the following catagories: HBV DNA, HBV RNA, HBeAg, and HBcrAg.

ARO-HBV has been shown to be well tolerated by all in the trial. Results show that monthly RNAi with ARO-HBV effectively reduces all measurable viral products in patients, most notably HBsAg, making it a clear potential treatment for Chronic Hepatitis B.

*ARO-AAT*

Arrowhead is targeting Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a genetic disorder which causes liver disease in both children and adults. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a glycoprotein produced primarily in hepatocytes, wherein a PiZ mutation can cause improper folding of the protein and potentially leading to globules. An accumulation of globules can lead to a recurrent cycle of hepatic injury, fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and more.

ARO-AAT is a hepatocyte targeted RNAi drug which functions to halt production of Z-AAT protein, in turn preventing liver globules. In the study, 45 healthy volunteers were given escalating single or multiple doses of ARO-AAT or placebo in a round of 4 placebo:4 active, where patients received a single 35 mg doses of ARO-AAT or placebo. Multi-dose patients were also in a round of 4 placebo:4 active and received three doses every 28 days at doses of 100, 200 or 300 mg. Meanwhile, the study enrolled 4 patients to each receive a single dose of ARO-AAT at 100, 200 and 300 mg to assess single dose duration of response.

Again, fortunately for Arrowhead, there were no reported deaths or severe adverse events associated with the study to date. Single dose serum AAT mean nadir reductions from baseline of:


79% at 35 mg

87% at 100 mg

&gt;91% at 200 mg

&gt;91% at 300mg 

According to the company, ""Multi-dose mean nadir serum AAT reductions were &gt;91% at all dose levels with most subjects BLQ. Maximum AAT reduction across all cohorts was &gt;94%. A greater than 90% reduction was sustained for at least 8 weeks following the last dose in the lowest multi-dose cohort (100 mg), the only cohort with data of this duration."" 

In the study, ARO-AAT has been well tolerated at the highest multi-dose level and has indicated high inhibition of hepatic AAT synthesis, drastically reducing the genesis of liver globules. 



*Financials*

Without taking into consideration the $175M that the company is receiving, nor any potential equity purchases or money generated from the JNJ deal, the company has reported having cash or cash equivalents on hand of $78.1M as of June 30, 2018.  The company at the time only had enough on hand to fund operations for the next 12 months.  While this had previously caused concern for additional financing before, the JNJ deal essentially triples the company's available cash on hand and can support operations for greater than likely two years, preventing the need to do an public offering any time soon.  The company currently stands on solid financial ground with plenty of cash on hand as well as potential funding for additional research, potential milestone payments, and potential future royalties from commercial sales.



*Market*

According to GBI Research, approximately 350 million people worldwide are infected with chronic hepatitis B, leading to 780,000 patient deaths each year. 

Globally, the hepatitis B therapeutics market is served predominately by Baraclude and Viread, both of which have received black-box warnings from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This label leads the hepatitis b treatment to be considered being a market with a large unmet need.  The global market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.3% from the current $2.9 billion to $3.5 billion. 

Due to being very well tolerated and clinically successful thus far, the potential of ARO-HBV being FDA approved without a black-box warning seems likely.



#*Review*

I believe that Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals is a great buying opportunity at these current levels.  Investors reacted oddly in my opinion to the great news of the company receiving $175M in payments and potential for massive amounts of revenues exceeding $3.5B.  This prevents any short term financing or dilution that the company would have otherwise needed in order to operate moving forward.  The safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of the products being presented in the upcoming AASLD shows that JNJ was not mistaken in investing in this company.  Although Arrowhead could have likely garnered higher revenues and income in the long term if they had kept global licensing rights, the potential royalties as well as potential future funding of research is a great opportunity for this company to be able to focus financing on developing the other 6 products that it has in its pipeline.  I don't see a full logical reason for this stock to be trading at these lower valuations, I fully believe this is a steal under $15.

Massive consumer response to AMC Stubs and AMC Stubs A-List as both beat all membership expectations

To better serve AMC Stubs and AMC Stubs A-List guests, who tend to book their tickets online, AMC is rolling out across its theatre network more movie-going convenience features like reserved seating and online concession ordering

AMC enables multiple A-List accounts to be charged to one credit card and extending plan eligibility to guests who are at least 16 years old

AMC is holding the line on A-List pricing for 2019, still to be $19.95 per month in 35 states

Beginning January 9, 2019, a modest AMC Stubs A-List monthly price adjustment to apply in 15 states and the District of Columbia

AMC reaffirms its $19.95 12-month price guarantee to all current AMC Stubs A-List members and all new members who sign up before January 9, 2019

LEAWOOD, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AMC Theatres® is excited to announce that AMC Stubs A-List will cross more than 500,000 enrolled members between this weekend and next weekend, eclipsing the Company’s membership expectations for the end of the first full year in just 4 1/2 months. Thanks in part to the popularity of A-List, the overall AMC Stubs program has surpassed 17 million member households, up from about 2.5 million member households only 2 1/2 years ago.

With the surging popularity of A-List which is also propelling more and more people to book their tickets online, AMC is taking further steps to make the movie-going experience more convenient than ever before.

Beginning immediately, households can use a common credit card as the payment method for separate, individual A-List accounts.
Also effective immediately, AMC has extended the minimum age for AMC Stubs A-List from 18 years old currently to 16 years old with a valid photo ID.
AMC plans to roll out reserved seating in all AMC-branded theatres and AMC DINE-IN theatres by June of 2019. This increase in reserved seating locations will not apply to AMC CLASSIC branded theatres.
Also by the end of June 2019, all guests going to all the AMC-branded theatres in the metropolitan areas of Boston, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, San Diego, and San Francisco will have access to AMC “Mobile Ordering,” which lets guests purchase their food and drinks online at the same time as they reserve their tickets, easily and conveniently picking them up when they arrive at the theatre. Mobile Ordering already exists and is functioning well at 52 locations in 24 markets around the country.
In addition to these added benefits for AMC guests around the country, AMC is holding the line on A-List pricing for 2019, still unchanged at $19.95 plus tax per month in 35 states. AMC is making modest pricing adjustments in states where the program is most popular. Beginning January 9, 2019, the monthly price of AMC Stubs A-List will move to $21.95 plus tax for guests in Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington state and The District of Columbia. The program moves to $23.95 plus tax for guests in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York.

Even so, all current A-List members as well as any new members who sign up before January 9, 2019, will continue to enjoy their 12-month $19.95 price guarantee from the start of their membership. So, to pick two illustrative examples, A-List members in Los Angeles who signed up in September of 2018 at a price of $19.95 won’t see any price change for their memberships until their September 2019 billing cycle, or those in New York who will sign up as new A-List members in December of 2018 at a price of $19.95 won’t see any price change for their memberships until their December 2019 billing cycle.

AMC will continue to operate its A-List program with transparency and clarity. So that A-List members can always know what they can expect with reliability and predictability, AMC hereby warrants that for all guests who join on or after January 9, 2019, the Company will provide at least 90-days advance notice before making any changes to their A-List program’s pricing or benefits. Additionally, reflecting commitments already made, for those A-List members who have joined or will join before January 9, 2019, they are assured not only of 90-days advance notice of any future change in pricing or benefits, but also that no such change would apply to them until 12 months after their initial enrollment date. As a reputable operator, AMC has no desire to whipsaw its guests with frequent change, nor would it do so without providing guests reasonable advance notice.

All other aspects of the AMC Stubs A-List program remain unchanged, including:

Up to three movies per week, in every available AMC showtime and format, including IMAX at AMC, Dolby Cinema at AMC, RealD 3D and Prime at AMC
AMC Stubs A-List can be used at the spur of the moment or also can make planning ahead days or weeks in advance possible, as securing tickets is made easy via reservations capabilities on the AMCTheatres.com web site, or on the AMC Theatres mobile app.
AMC Stubs A-List members also enjoy all the discounts and benefits of AMC Stubs Premiere, including free upgrades on popcorn and soda, free refills on large popcorn, express service at the box office and concession stand, no online ticketing fees and 100 points for every $1 spent for the AMC Stubs A-List monthly fee, tickets purchased for friends and family, and food &amp; beverage spending at AMC.
AMC Stubs Premiere and A-List members receive a $5 reward for every 5,000 points earned, which translates to a 10% credit toward future AMC purchases.
Adam Aron, AMC CEO and President, said, “In our minds, increasing enrollments to 17 million AMC Stubs member households over the past 2 1/2 years, or achieving initial enrollments of a half million members in AMC Stubs A-List in just 4 1/2 months, are astounding numbers. We have immensely successful programs here, and there should be no doubt, AMC Stubs and AMC Stubs A-List are here to stay with these programs’ structures and valuable benefits remaining fully intact. Our objective for these programs is that they continue to be both popular and profitable. Our decision to keep the AMC Stubs A-List monthly price unchanged in 35 states, along with only a modest price adjustment in some key markets going in place in early 2019, will keep us in that sweet spot of successfully balancing profits and popularity. We encourage current A-List members to tell their friends and families that our 12-month price and benefit guarantee remains fully in place for A-List members who have already joined or who do so prior to January 9, 2019. So, the program pricing of $19.95 will remain at that level for everyone and will be unchanged anywhere for a full 12 months after initial enrollment if moviegoers act now to become A-Listers.”

For information about AMC Stubs A-List and to sign up, guests can inquire at their local AMC Theatre, or at AMC’s web site amctheatres.com/alist or on AMC’s iOS and Android mobile apps after downloading or updating them with the latest app release.

With such a huge focus on cyber security lately, the top tools in each domain have been crushing earnings this year. My two biggest wins last quarter have been in Splunk (security audit logging) and Okta (Identity Management as a service, i.e. cloud). CyberArk will be the third.

It is in Google's best interest for Shopify to succeed as they could defend Google from Amazon and their growing share in online searches. 

According to Jumpshot, Amazon passed Google in 2018 for initial product search. If Google was to acquire Shopify, they can effectively dominate product search, therefore ad revenue, as Shopify (in a successful state) will host the majority of small and medium sized companies ecommerce platforms.

0,5027,Apple leads the decline of tech stocks.,"Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks turned lower on Wednesday as Apple Inc led a decline in technology stocks, offsetting early support from tame U.S. consumer prices data and a rebound in oil prices.

The iPhone maker's shares fell 2 percent, extending its losses for the fifth straight day. A raft of profit warnings from Apple's suppliers has fueled investor concerns that iPhone sales, in terms of volume, have hit a wall.

The S&amp;P technology index was down 0.8 percent, hurt by losses in Microsoft Corp and Adobe Inc .

Markets earlier got a boost from data that showed U.S. consumer prices increased 0.3 percent in October amid a rise in gasoline and rental costs, but were in line with expectations.

The S&amp;P energy index which had risen in morning trade on a rebound in oil prices, following a 7 percent plunge on Tuesday, also gave up gains.

""The markets never really left correction mode and it will be with us for a while, at least till the selling into strengths keeps happening,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.

An escalating trade war between the United States and China, worries about rising interest rates and slowing corporate profits have stalled gains for U.S. stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 trading about 7 percent below its record level.

At 11:41 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 159.75 points, or 0.63 percent, at 25,126.74, the S&amp;P 500 was down 16.07 points, or 0.59 percent, at 2,706.11 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 48.96 points, or 0.68 percent, at 7,151.91.

The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.6 percent at the open, reversing later in the day as all the 11 major S&amp;P sectors moved into the red.

""We would think if it were a sustained move higher, volatility coming into the end of year would be lower than 19 or 20,"" said Laurence Benedict, founder of Opportunistic Trader.

""People are forgetting that on Monday the market was down 600 points, basically we're trying to stabilize at lower levels.""

The CBOE Volatility index, an indicator of short-term volatility in the stock market, touched more than 1-week high at 21.20 points.

The S&amp;P utilities index fell 1.06 percent after PG&amp;E Corp slumped 22.7 percent on warnings it could face ""significant liability"" in excess of its insurance coverage in the event that its equipment was found to have caused the blaze in California..

Snap Inc fell 3 percent after Reuters reported that U.S. regulators have subpoenaed the social media app maker for information about its March 2017 initial public offering.

0,5040,$AAPL DD Inside,"DISCLAIMER: I'm not an expert, but I once took an economics class

Apple's drop in iphone sales isn't a big deal. For any of you that took a microeconomics class you may remember elasticity of demand, this is a measure of how much the demand changes for a product when the price is changed. Iphones have a relatively inelastic demand, meaning that with a change in the price, the quantity demanded by consumers will not change as much.

EXAMPLE: Price increases 20%, demand will only decrease by 10%

The image is a graphical representation of this concept.

I'm sure that when Apple decided to increase their prices they had analysts examine sales data. They likely know what they're doing. And came to the conclusion that with a price increase they could increase their overall sales revenue. Their decision to no longer report unit sales was likely to prevent a drastic drop of $AAPL. The recent decline in $AAPL is an overreaction in my opinion, and when people realize this it will return to previous highs. PAPA BUFFET knows this and he ain't worried. I'm buying $AAPL calls til I'm out of money, then I'll take a loan and buy more. TENDIES INCOMING!!!!

0,5049,$PCG Distressed Debt Analysis,"With all the WSB bears piling onto PCG shorts I wanted to see what type of outlook the shares are currently reflecting to see if there is long term distressed debt contrarian value here.  As of this writing PCG is trading at 17.40 with a market cap of 13.23 billion.  Before the wildfire liability concern PCG was trading at 48.8 with a market cap of 37.104 billion.  A difference of 23.8748 billion, so investors are extremely worried and starting to price potential bankruptcy.  Theres also news of liability insurance falling short and this is likely exacerbating the issue.  Using wikipedia for reference for some numbers and referencing real estate averages on google I'm attempting to generate a liability range.  Sources and chart included at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

Quick review shows two ongoing fires.  Campe Butte and Woolsey Los Angeles.  Between the two of these there are allegedly 287 people missing or dead, 9620 residential buildings destroyed, 260 commercial buildings destroyed, and 238362 acres of land destroyed.  Camp butte's containment is currently at 40% and Woolsey is at 57%.  

&amp;#x200B;

Using google to get insurance averages, here are some values that I'm using

* Time article for insurance prices human life around 129000.  
* Average residential is 544900.  
* Average commercial is 3302924.  
* Average acre is 7200.

Doing simple average damage so far is \~7.62 billion.  I'm using this as the floor for my estimate.  This would assume that everything is resolved rapidly and no further damage.  The way that I am calculating the high end is that I am doubling the amount due to containment being at 40%, however, this is likely an extremely high estimate because fire damage is exponential, not linear, and likely the worst has already passed.  But there will be lawsuits coming and so will be giving ourselves lots of buffer.  Using the double metric puts damage projections at 15.24 billion.  The high end of my estimate is still 8.63 billion short of how investors are pricing the damage.  

&amp;#x200B;

High damage estimate - 15.24 billion

Low damage estimate - 7.62 billion

Current equity damage estimate - 23.87 billion

Discrepancy from high - 8.63 billion

Discrepancy from low - 16.25 billion

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming we conclude the the fires at the high end of the estimate then PCG could return to trading at 24 with a market cap of 21.9 billion, so still damaged, but far less than currently expected.

&amp;#x200B;

Price target: $24

&amp;#x200B;

This trade will require conclusion of lawsuits and the like, so don't expect this to be resolved by the EOW.  This would be a buy the equity or sell a put credit spread, preferable being put credit spread as that benefits from theta.

Prior to market close yesterday (3:50 EST) I was like fuck it lets try it again, got 11/23 $22 puts with the profits at an average of $5.10.

\-From what I have read and discovered, the after hours price movement is due to an official(s) stating that they will not let PG&amp;E go bankrupt and there is a California law that protects that from such a disaster. There are a bunch of other rumors such as another location that started the fire etc...

Main question now is double down on puts or sell for a loss and hop onto calls.

Next week you might be able to play Short or Long $SQ

**Long:**

There is support at $60 which was tested a couple of times back in May and July (See Blue Line). Should that support hold, the next test would be a well established descending trend line (see Orange line) that should come into play next week. If Square can break that trend line there won't be another resistance level until around $74 (see the Yellow line). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Short:** 

If the $60 support line is broken next week, load up on puts because the next support won't be until $40, test numerous times in May. ",2018-12-14 22:53:55,"['SQ', 'SQ']"

0,5291,$UNFI DD,"UNFI is the largest wholesaler in the US. They acquired Supervalu - which was the largest wholesaler in the recent past. Stock has totally died due to excessive leverage pro-forma (5.1x). After looking at multiple youtube videos of warehouses and staff my impression is UNFI is a well managed company; Supervalu was terribly managed. There is good scope to improve operations like consolidate warehouses (each has \~30), improve organization in supervalu. Supervalu mainly sells to smaller retailers with higher gross margins - yet it had worser net margins. Think UNFI management can fix that.

There is an impression that UNFI overpaid for SVU - stock price was $20 when they agreed to acquire for $32. This misses the fact that most of capital structure of SVU was debt and the EV to EBIDTA was 5x. So the net premium was much smaller. Supervalu also owns lot of real estate - it's a shit old company that at book value was worth 1 billion.
