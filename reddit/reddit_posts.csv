0,wallstreetbets,Tastyworks capping commission's to $10,"&gt; Starting tomorrow, on Jan 2nd, 2018, tastyworks is introducing capped commissions for large option trades. This means the most commission you will pay for any single leg option trade is $10* (plus clearing fees). That’s right, just $10* per leg.

  
Is it the Robinhood effect? Not useful to me as I don't trade these many contracts in single trade, but would be useful to a lot of users here.",2018-01-01 07:50:16

Long $BUD - makers of Budweiser, Bud Light, Busch Light, and Natty Light. Nuff said..

Long $MO - makers of Marlboro, Skoal, Copenhagen, and Husky. Go long mouth cancer treatment companies for the real long play here. 

Long babies named Kirby, Nick, Jake, and Jalen. Long any baby camo outfit companies as well. Sales are going to be record breaking in 9 months. Long babies named Kody too - seems to be a popular name among the people of the Confederate States. 

Both teams have red or a red-ish color in their logos. Long red dye futures for all the memorabilia/talking bass/truck flags that will be produced.

0,wallstreetbets,What'd you throw your Roth IRA money at?,"As everyone knows, Roth IRA's let you YOLO your post-tax dollars on all-or-nothing gambles that Uncle Sam can't tax you on later. I'm pretty sure they designed it to heavily incentivize risky behavior, but they only way Congress would allow it is if they pretended it was for poor people to ""retire"". As a result, the first trading day of the New Year, is one of my favorite days of the year. 

In 2014 I threw it at SSYS on the 3D printer hype and sold it last year for like 70% loss. In 2015 I ""diversified"" by throwing it all at various oil stocks, including CVX and COP. 2016... I forget. Probably played it safe since I started browsing /r/investing and stopped being a complete fuckwit.

2017 I learned about WSB and threw it all at weedstocks. Yay.

2018, $5.5K to Hasbro. I now have 107 shares in this account, 11 more and a $100 2020 LEAP in another.

0,wallstreetbets,1/2 Calls and Puts with a new equity screener,"I'm back after taking the last week of the year off from logging into any of my accounts to see the pain.

This weeks sheet is up.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eln8p99doK0GBOZJOD2obOk3jzaS920yom4wt7RUfZ0/edit?usp=sharing

I've included a new tab based off a screener for individual equities using different filters. 

What I look for is really:

Decent P/E

Debt to equity ratio of &lt;=175%

ROE &gt;=10%

ROA &gt;=10% (looking for stocks that don't require debt leverage for ROA)

Positive P/E estimate for 2018

Net profit margin &gt;=5%

Then sort from there.

Here are the column descriptions:

Symbol - duh

Company	- duh

Sector	-duh 

D/E	- Debt to Equity (expressed as % so 175% = 1.75/1)

NPM	- Net Profit Margin

Est. EPS Growth	 - estimated EPS growth from 2017 to 2018 estimate

Rev Growth - revenue growth from prior TTM to this TTM	

P/E - current Price to Earnings

P/E Est 2018 - estimated P/E

P/C - Price to Cash Flow (default sorted)

P/B	- Price to Book

ROE	- Return on Equity

ROA	- Return on  Assets

Distance from PT - Distance from price target per Merrill Lynch (who I like the most). A positive numbers means it is X% **under** the target (so a $9 stock with a $10 PT would be 10%). A negative number means it is X% over the target.

BofA Merrill Lynch rating (low is good)

CFRA rating (high is good)

Morningstar (high is good)

0,wallstreetbets,Tastyworks is having a drawing each month this year to give away completely free commission on all stock and option trades for the next 5 years.,"Just read this from their new year's email
&gt;But we’re not done. As an added bonus, tastyworks will have twelve monthly drawings for funded accounts (minimum of $2,000) and each month, one customer will win free commissions for 5 years. And no, we haven’t lost our minds. We simply want to do something special and this is just the start.

I know Robinhood already does free commission for stocks, but Tastyworks is actually a legit platform and is the absolute best when it comes to trading options in my opinion.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7mgfjk/ugaz_on_the_nice_list/

As you can see this has been quite the ride from $2.5 and I do not believe we are done yet. We just set a record on a daily consumption (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-02/america-is-burning-more-gas-than-ever-as-chill-grips-east-chart) and the weather forcast looks like we will remain cold for at least another 10 days. So what does that mean? When comparing storage levels (currently at 3,318) with past years levels and comparing this weeks and next weeks demand I estimate a draw of 250-400 this week and 200-350 next week putting us at around 2014 levels that supported a price range of ~$4.50-$6. Do I actually believe we will get anywhere near $6? no but I think hovering around $4 is a real possibility in the next 30 days and you should to.
